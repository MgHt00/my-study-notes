[G] That's a very insightful question, and it highlights a subtle but important distinction! You're right to question if the "initial value as defined in the CSS specification" and the "value established by the user-agent stylesheet" are the same, as they can often appear to be. However, they are conceptually distinct, even if they sometimes align in practice.

Here's the breakdown of the difference:

**1. The Initial Value (Defined in the CSS Specification):**

* This is a fundamental, *theoretical* default value for each CSS property. It's part of the formal definition of the property in the CSS specification documents (like those from the W3C).
* The specification dictates what this initial value *should* be. For example, the initial value of `color` is usually `black`, the initial value of `display` is `inline`, and the initial value of `position` is `static`.
* This initial value is what a property would have if *no* styles from any source (author, user, or user-agent) are applied to the element for that specific property.
* Think of it as the absolute starting point for that property, according to the rules of CSS itself.

**2. The Value Established by the User-Agent Stylesheet (Browser Defaults):**

* The **user-agent stylesheet** is the set of default styles that each web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) applies to HTML elements. These styles ensure a basic level of rendering even without any author-provided CSS.
* While browser vendors try to adhere to the initial values defined in the CSS specifications, they have the freedom to set their own default styles in their user-agent stylesheets. These defaults might sometimes *coincide* with the specification's initial value, but they can also be different.
* For example, the CSS specification defines the initial value of the `display` property as `inline`. However, a browser's user-agent stylesheet will set `display: block` for `<div>` elements, `display: inline` for `<span>` elements, and so on, to make the basic structure of HTML work as expected. These browser defaults *override* the specification's initial value for those elements.
* Similarly, while the initial value of `font-family` isn't a specific typeface in the specification, browsers will have their own default font choices (e.g., Times New Roman in some older browsers, or a system font).

**Analogy:**

Imagine you're building with LEGO bricks.

* **The initial value (CSS specification):** This is like the default state of a particular type of brick as described in the LEGO instruction manual. For example, a standard 2x4 brick inherently has no other bricks attached to it.
* **The value established by the user-agent stylesheet (browser defaults):** This is like the pre-assembled basic structures that come in the LEGO set. The instructions might say a 2x4 brick's initial state is detached, but the set might include a small car base where several 2x4 bricks are already connected in a specific way. These pre-assembled parts (browser defaults) provide a functional starting point that goes beyond the individual brick's initial state.

**Key Difference:**

* **`initial`** always goes back to the *fundamental, specification-defined* starting point for that property.
* **`revert`** goes back to the *browser's own default styling* for that element and property, which might be different from the specification's initial value due to the user-agent stylesheet.

**In Practice:**

Often, for properties that don't have significant default styling in browsers (beyond the specification's initial value), `initial` and `revert` might seem to produce the same result. However, for properties like `display`, `font-family`, margins on the `<body>`, etc., where browsers have strong default styles, the difference between `initial` and `revert` will be much more apparent.

Therefore, while the user-agent stylesheet might *sometimes* set a property to its specification-defined initial value, they are not inherently the same thing. `initial` is about the CSS specification, while `revert` is about the browser's implementation of those (and potentially other) defaults.

Does this distinction between the specification's initial value and the user-agent's default value make more sense now?
