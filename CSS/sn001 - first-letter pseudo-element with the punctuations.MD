[G] That's a very insightful question! Based on how browsers generally interpret the specification, the `::first-letter` pseudo-element in the case of `...and` would likely select **all three dots (`...`) along with the 'a'**.

Here's the reasoning:

The specification emphasizes that "punctuation that precedes or follows the first letter unit...should be included." In this case, the "first letter unit" is the 'a'. The three dots immediately precede it and are considered part of that initial visual unit.

Therefore, if you had the following CSS:

```css
p::first-letter {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

Applied to the HTML:

```html
<p>...and so on.</p>
```

You would likely see "...a" rendered in blue and with a larger font size.

**Think of it visually:** The browser tries to identify what a user would perceive as the beginning of the text. The ellipsis closely leads into the word "and," so it's treated as part of that initial chunk for styling purposes.

It's always a good idea to test these edge cases in a browser to see the precise rendering, as browser implementations can sometimes have minor variations. However, the general understanding is that preceding punctuation directly attached to the first letter unit will be included in the `::first-letter` selection.
