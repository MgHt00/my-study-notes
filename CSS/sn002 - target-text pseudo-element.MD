[G] Ah, `::target-text` is a relatively new and quite interesting pseudo-element! It's part of the CSS Scroll Anchoring specification (Level 1) and is designed to style the text that is the target of a URL fragment.

Let's break it down:

**What is a URL Fragment?**

You've probably seen URLs with a `#` symbol followed by some text at the end, like `https://example.com/page#section-title`. The part after the `#` is called the **fragment identifier**. Traditionally, when you navigate to a URL with a fragment identifier, the browser scrolls to the HTML element that has an `id` attribute matching that fragment.

**The Purpose of `::target-text`**

The `::target-text` pseudo-element allows you to specifically style the text content of the element that is currently the target of the URL fragment. This can be useful for visually highlighting the section of the page that the user has navigated to via a link with a fragment.

**How it Works**

When a URL with a fragment identifier is accessed, and there's an element in the document with an `id` that matches the fragment, that element becomes the "target element." The `::target-text` pseudo-element then selects the text content of that target element (and its descendants).

**Example:**

Let's say you have the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Target Text Example</title>
<style>
  :target-text {
    background-color: yellow;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Page Content</h1>

  <h2 id="section1">This is Section One. Some interesting text here.</h2>
  <p>More content...</p>

  <h2 id="section2">Here is Section Two with even more details.</h2>
  <p>And even more...</p>

  <p><a href="#section2">Go to Section Two</a></p>

</body>
</html>
```

1.  If a user clicks the "Go to Section Two" link, the URL in their browser will change to `your-page.html#section2`.
2.  The browser will scroll to the `<h2>` element with the `id="section2"`.
3.  The CSS rule `:target-text` will then apply the `background-color: yellow` and `font-weight: bold` styles to the text content of the target element (`<h2>Here is Section Two with even more details.</h2>`).

**Key Considerations:**

* **Specificity:** Like other pseudo-elements, `::target-text` has its own level of specificity in CSS.
* **Only Text Content:** It specifically targets the text content within the target element and its descendants. It doesn't style the target element itself (for that, you'd use the `:target` pseudo-class).
* **Dynamic:** The styling applied by `::target-text` is dynamic. If the URL fragment changes, the target element changes, and the styling will be applied to the new target's text content.
* **Browser Support:** As it's a newer feature, browser support might still be evolving. It's good to check the current browser compatibility.

**Use Cases:**

* **Highlighting Linked Sections:** Making it very clear which part of a long document the user has navigated to via a link.
* **Improving Accessibility:** Providing a visual cue for users who might rely on visual highlighting to understand where they've landed on a page.

**In Summary:**

`::target-text` is a CSS pseudo-element that allows you to style the text content of the HTML element that is the current target of the URL fragment identifier. It provides a way to visually emphasize the specific section of a page that a user has navigated to using a fragment link.
