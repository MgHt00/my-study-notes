[G] That's an excellent and very insightful question! You've correctly identified a potential contradiction between the authors' discussion of setting a *minimum* font size and their use of the `max()` function in the example.

Let's break down their reasoning and why using `max()` in this context makes sense for ensuring a *minimum* accessible font size.

**Understanding `max()`**

The `max()` CSS function allows you to set the largest (most positive or least negative) value from a comma-separated list of values as the value of a CSS property.

**The Accessibility Concern with Minimum Font Sizes**

As the authors rightly point out, setting a fixed `min-font-size` can be problematic for accessibility. If a user has set a preference for larger text in their browser or operating system to improve readability, a fixed `min-font-size` might prevent the text from scaling up to their preferred size, thus hindering accessibility.

**Why `max()` Helps Ensure a Minimum Accessible Size**

The key to understanding the authors' recommendation lies in how `max()` interacts with different relative units, especially `rem`.

Let's analyze the example:

```css
font-size: max(1vh, 0.75em, 1rem);
```

Here, the browser will calculate the value of each of the three expressions (`1vh`, `0.75em`, and `1rem`) and then apply the *largest* of these three calculated values as the `font-size`.

* **`1vh`:** This is relative to the viewport height. On very small screens, this value might become quite small.

* **`0.75em`:** This is relative to the `font-size` of the *current* element. If the parent element has a very small font size, `0.75em` could also become quite small.

* **`1rem`:** This is relative to the `font-size` of the **root (`<html>`) element**. The root element's font size is often set by the user's browser settings (typically a default of 16px). Importantly, users who need larger text will often adjust their *browser's default font size*.

**The Logic:**

By using `max(1vh, 0.75em, 1rem)`, the authors are ensuring that the `font-size` will *always* be at least as large as `1rem`. Here's why:

* If `1vh` or `0.75em` happen to be larger than `1rem` on a particular screen or due to inheritance, then the `font-size` will be that larger value, allowing for responsiveness.

* However, if `1vh` or `0.75em` become very small (potentially violating accessibility guidelines), the `1rem` value will act as a floor or a **minimum**. This is because `1rem` is tied to the user's root font size preference. If the user has increased their default font size, `1rem` will also be larger, ensuring that the text doesn't become too small to read.

**In essence, `1rem` acts as an accessibility anchor in the `max()` function.** It ensures that the font size will always respect the user's potential base font size preference, preventing the font from becoming unreadably small even if the viewport-based or element-based relative units suggest a smaller size.

**Why not `min()`?**

Using `min()` would have the opposite effect. `min(1vh, 0.75em, 1rem)` would select the *smallest* of the three values, potentially leading to very tiny and inaccessible text if `1vh` or `0.75em` become small.

**Therefore, the authors use `max()` to ensure that the final font size is *at least* `1rem`, effectively setting a dynamic minimum that respects the user's root font size preference and promotes accessibility.**

Your careful reading and questioning have highlighted a crucial point about using CSS functions for accessibility! It's all about selecting the *largest* value to guarantee a readable minimum based on the root font size.
