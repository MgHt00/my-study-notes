Okay, this is a cornerstone concept in CSS positioning: how `position: absolute;` elements find their reference point. The authors are describing a very specific and crucial rule for determining the containing block of an absolutely positioned element.

Let's break down that statement and then illustrate it.

**Understanding `position: absolute;`**

When an element has `position: absolute;`, it is:

1.  **Taken out of the normal document flow:** It no longer affects the layout of other elements.
2.  **Positioned relative to its containing block:** Its `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties (offset properties) are calculated based on the edges of its containing block.

**The Rule: Finding the Containing Block for `position: absolute;`**

The authors state: "For a non-root element that has a `position` value of `absolute`, its containing block is set to the nearest ancestor that has a `position` value **other than `static`**."

* **"Nearest ancestor":** This means the element's parent, or its parent's parent, and so on, up the HTML tree, until it finds one that meets the next condition.
* **"Position value other than `static`":** This is the critical part. An ancestor must have `position: relative;`, `position: absolute;`, `position: fixed;`, or `position: sticky;` to become the containing block for an absolutely positioned child.
* **If no such ancestor exists:** If an absolutely positioned element has no ancestor with a non-static position, its containing block defaults all the way up to the **initial containing block** (which is the viewport).

**The Second Part: "If the ancestor is block-level, the containing block is set to be that element's padding edge; in other words, the area that would be bounded by a border."**

Once the browser finds the nearest ancestor that meets the non-static position criteria, that ancestor becomes the containing block. The specific *edges* of this containing block, which the `top`/`left`/etc. offsets of the absolute element will refer to, are its **padding edges**.

* **Padding Edge:** This refers to the inner edge of an element's padding. It's the area where content would sit, immediately inside any padding and before any border.
* **"Area that would be bounded by a border":** This is a helpful clarification. If an element has a border, the padding edge is the line just inside that border. If it has no border, it's still the conceptual edge where a border *would* be.

**Illustration:**

Let's use an example to make this clear.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  .container {
    position: relative; /* This makes it the containing block */
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    padding: 20px; /* This padding affects the containing block's edges */
    border: 5px solid blue; /* This border is OUTSIDE the padding edge */
    background-color: lightgray;
    margin: 50px;
  }

  .absolute-box {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;    /* Relative to the containing block's top padding edge */
    left: 10px;   /* Relative to the containing block's left padding edge */
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: lightcoral;
    border: 2px solid red;
  }

  .static-box {
    /* position: static; (default) - will NOT be a containing block */
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 10px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

  <div class="static-box">This is a static box. It won't be a containing block.</div>

  <div class="container">
    Container (position: relative)
    <div class="absolute-box">Absolute</div>
  </div>

  <p>Some other content.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Visual Breakdown of `.container` (the Containing Block):**

|    |   +-------------------+   |   |
|    |                           |   |

**How `.absolute-box` is Positioned:**

1.  `.absolute-box` has `position: absolute;`.
2.  Its nearest ancestor with a non-static position is `.container` (which has `position: relative;`).
3.  Therefore, `.container` is the containing block for `.absolute-box`.
4.  Since `.container` is a block-level element, the reference point for `.absolute-box`'s `top` and `left` is the **padding edge** of `.container`.
5.  `top: 10px;` means 10px down from the top padding edge of `.container`.
6.  `left: 10px;` means 10px right from the left padding edge of `.container`.

**Result:** The "Absolute" box will appear 10px in from the inner side of the blue border of the "Container" box.

This rule is fundamental for accurately placing elements with `position: absolute;` and achieving complex layouts. Understanding the "padding edge" as the reference is key.
