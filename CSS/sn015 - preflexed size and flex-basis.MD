That's an interesting term "preflexed size"! It's not a standard CSS property or a term directly defined in the Flexbox specification itself, but it's a very descriptive and useful way to think about a flex item's dimensions.

When the authors use "preflexed size," they are almost certainly referring to the size of a flex item **before the Flexbox layout algorithm has applied its growing and shrinking calculations.**

More specifically, the "preflexed size" of an item is primarily determined by its **`flex-basis`** value.

Let's break it down:

1.  **`flex-basis`:** This property defines the *initial* main size of a flex item before any `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink` calculations are performed.
    * If `flex-basis` is set to a specific length (e.g., `100px`, `50%`), that's its preflexed size.
    * If `flex-basis` is `auto` (which is the default if not explicitly set), then the preflexed size is determined by the item's content's intrinsic size (e.g., the width of an image, or the width required by the text content). If `width` or `height` is also set, `flex-basis: auto;` respects that dimension.

2.  **The Flexbox Algorithm:** Once the "preflexed size" (or `flex-basis`) of all flex items is determined, the Flexbox algorithm then looks at the available space in the flex container and applies the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` factors to distribute that space (or remove excess space).

    * **If there's extra space:** Items with a `flex-grow` value greater than `0` will expand beyond their preflexed size.
    * **If there's not enough space:** Items with a `flex-shrink` value greater than `0` (the default) will shrink below their preflexed size.

**Analogy:**

Imagine you have a group of inflatable balloons (flex items) and a box (flex container).

* **"Preflexed size"** is like the size of each balloon when you first take it out of the package. It's its initial, uninflated or uncompressed size. This is what its `flex-basis` dictates.
* Then, you put them in the box.
    * If there's empty space in the box, some balloons might **grow** (`flex-grow`) to fill it.
    * If the balloons are too big for the box, some balloons might **shrink** (`flex-shrink`) to fit.

The "preflexed size" is the size *before* this growing or shrinking adjustment happens.

**Example:**

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="item item-a">Item A</div>
  <div class="item item-b">Item B</div>
  <div class="item item-c">Item C</div>
</div>
```

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  width: 500px;
  border: 2px solid purple;
}

.item {
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.item-a {
  flex-basis: 100px; /* Preflexed size: 100px */
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.item-b {
  flex-basis: 200px; /* Preflexed size: 200px */
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.item-c {
  /* flex-basis: auto; (default) - its content size becomes its preflexed size */
  /* If Item C's content "Item C" needs 70px to display */
  /* Preflexed size: 70px */
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

In this example:

* The "preflexed size" of Item A is 100px.
* The "preflexed size" of Item B is 200px.
* The "preflexed size" of Item C (with `flex-basis: auto;`) is determined by the width of its content, let's say 70px.

Total "preflexed size" = 100px + 200px + 70px = 370px.
The flex container width is 500px.
Remaining space = 500px - 370px = 130px.

Since all items have `flex-grow: 1`, that 130px will be equally distributed among them. Each item will grow by 130px / 3 = ~43.33px.

Their final sizes will be:
* Item A: 100px + 43.33px = 143.33px
* Item B: 200px + 43.33px = 243.33px
* Item C: 70px + 43.33px = 113.33px

So, "preflexed size" is essentially the `flex-basis` (or content size if `flex-basis` is `auto`) before the distribution of extra or insufficient space.
