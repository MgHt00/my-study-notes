Yes, a `1fr` track **can resolve to zero width**, but with a very important caveat regarding its content and intrinsic minimums.

Let's break it down:

1.  **`fr` units and "Free Space":**
    An `fr` unit (`1fr`, `2fr`, etc.) represents a fraction of the **available "free space"** within the grid container. "Free space" is what's left after all fixed-size columns (like `15em`), percentage columns (like `10%`), and columns that have hit their `max` limits in `minmax()` functions (like our `minmax(0, 500px)` column when it's at 500px) have taken their share.

2.  **When "Free Space" is Zero or Negative:**
    * If the total width of the fixed, percentage, and max-constrained tracks already *exceeds* or *equals* the grid container's width, then the "free space" for `fr` units becomes zero or negative.
    * In such a scenario, the Grid algorithm will attempt to make the `fr` tracks resolve to `0` width (or height for rows).

3.  **The Important Caveat: Implicit Minimum Content Size**
    By default, grid tracks have an **implicit minimum size** based on their content. This means:
    * A grid track generally won't shrink below the size needed to display its content without overflowing. For example, if you have a word like "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" in a cell, the column containing it might not shrink below the width needed to display that word (or to break it onto a new line, depending on CSS properties like `word-break`).
    * This implicit minimum is often `min-content` or `max-content` depending on the algorithm.

4.  **How to Force a `1fr` Track to Truly be Zero (if no space):**
    To ensure a `1fr` track can *actually* go down to `0` width (even if it contains content that would normally prevent it from doing so), you typically need to explicitly allow it:
    * **Using `minmax(0, 1fr)`:** This explicitly sets the track's minimum allowed size to `0`. If there's no free space, it will indeed become `0`.
    * **Using `min-width: 0;` on the grid items:** Setting `min-width: 0;` (or `min-height: 0;` for rows) on the *grid items themselves* within the track can override their content's intrinsic minimums, allowing the track to shrink to `0`. This is a common pattern to allow `fr` units to truly collapse when space is tight.

**In summary:**

* **Yes, conceptually**, if there's no available "free space," a `1fr` track is designed to take up `0` width.
* **Practically**, if that `1fr` track contains content, it might not *visually* become `0` width unless you also explicitly allow it to (by setting its minimum to `0` using `minmax(0, 1fr)` or by setting `min-width: 0` on its content). Without those overrides, it will shrink as much as possible, but might stop at its content's intrinsic minimum size.
