You've picked up on a very subtle but important detail in CSS font naming! The author's statement and example can be a bit confusing without full context, so let's break it down.

The quote is: **"While quoting font names is almost never required, if you leave off the quotation marks, user agents may ignore the font name and continue to the next available font in the font stack."**

And the example given: `h2 {font-family: Author, "cursive", cursive; }`

### What the Author's Statement Means (and When Quoting IS Required):

The "may ignore" part refers to specific scenarios where quotes are **not optional** and are, in fact, **mandatory**. If you omit quotes in these cases, the browser *will* ignore the font name. These cases are:

1.  **Font names containing spaces:**
    * **Correct:** `font-family: "Times New Roman";`
    * **Incorrect (ignored):** `font-family: Times New Roman;` (The browser sees "Times" and then "New", which is not a valid sequence for a single font name, so it stops parsing that part).
2.  **Font names that are CSS keywords:**
    * `inherit`, `initial`, `unset`, `revert`.
    * The generic font family keywords: `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, `fantasy`.
    * **Correct:** `font-family: "serif";` (if you literally had a font named "serif")
    * **Incorrect (ignored as a custom name, interpreted as a generic keyword):** `font-family: serif;` (The browser would treat this as the generic keyword, not a specific font file named "serif").
3.  **Font names that start with a digit or a hyphen followed by a digit.**

### Now, Let's Analyze Your Example: `h2 {font-family: Author, "cursive", cursive; }`

Your question is: "Does that mean, the provided font-name `Author` is ignored and use the font name with the quote `cursive`?"

**No, that's not what it means.** Let's go through the stack:

1.  **`Author` (unquoted):**
    * Since "Author" is a single word, does not contain spaces, and is not a CSS keyword, **quoting is technically optional here.**
    * The browser will **not ignore** `Author`. It will attempt to find and use a font named `Author` first. If you have `@font-face { font-family: 'Author'; ... }` defined or a system font named "Author", it will be used.

2.  **`"cursive"` (quoted):**
    * This is problematic. When you put quotation marks around a **generic font family keyword** (like `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, `fantasy`), you are telling the browser: "I am looking for a *specific font file* that is literally named 'cursive'."
    * It's highly, highly unlikely that a user will have a font file literally named "cursive" installed on their system. So, the browser will likely **fail to find this font** and move to the next one in the stack. This is generally considered bad practice.

3.  **`cursive` (unquoted):**
    * This is the standard and correct way to use the **generic font family keyword `cursive`**.
    * If `Author` is not found, and a literal font named `"cursive"` is not found, the browser will then fall back to its **default generic `cursive` font** (which might be "Comic Sans MS," "Segoe Print," or another script-like font on the user's system).

### So, the full flow of `h2 {font-family: Author, "cursive", cursive; }` would be:

1.  **Try `Author`:** If a font named "Author" is available (either via `@font-face` or as a system font), use it.
2.  **If `Author` is not found, try `"cursive"` (literal font name):** This will almost certainly fail because there's no system font or common web font literally named "cursive."
3.  **If `"cursive"` is not found, try `cursive` (generic keyword):** The browser will then render the text using its default generic `cursive` font.

The author's warning is primarily to ensure you **always quote font names that contain spaces or are CSS keywords** to avoid them being completely ignored or misinterpreted. For simple single-word custom names like `Author`, quoting is optional but often done for consistency.
