That's a very insightful question, as that sentence from your authors can be a bit confusing if not interpreted precisely in the context of `min-content`\!

Let's break down `min-content`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, and how they interact.

### 1\. What `min-content` Width Means

In CSS, `min-content` is a keyword that can be used for `width` (and `height`).

  * **For text content, `min-content` essentially means: "The width that the element needs to be without causing any overflow, assuming the content is laid out in its *most compact* form."**
  * This "most compact form" for text usually means the width of the **longest unbreakable string** of text.
      * An unbreakable string is typically a single word.
      * It could also be a sequence of words separated by non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`).

**Example Without `overflow-wrap: break-word`:**

Consider this HTML:

```html
<div style="width: min-content;">
  supercalifragilisticexpialidocious another word
</div>
```

Without `overflow-wrap: break-word`, the longest unbreakable string is "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious". So, `width: min-content;` would make the `<div>` **exactly as wide as that single, very long word**. It wouldn't wrap that word unless you explicitly set a fixed `width` smaller than the word.

### 2\. What `overflow-wrap: break-word` Does

  * The `overflow-wrap` property (previously `word-wrap`) controls how words are broken when they would otherwise overflow their container.
  * **`overflow-wrap: break-word;`** specifically tells the browser: "If a word is too long to fit on a line, you are allowed to break that word anywhere (even in the middle of it) to make it fit within its container."

### 3\. The Interaction: `overflow-wrap: break-word` and `min-content`

Now, let's put them together:

If you have `width: min-content;` **AND** `overflow-wrap: break-word;` on an element with a very long word:

```html
<div style="width: min-content; overflow-wrap: break-word;">
  supercalifragilisticexpialidocious another word
</div>
```

  * **How `min-content` is re-calculated:** Because `overflow-wrap: break-word;` is active, the browser now knows that it's allowed to break words at *any* character (or almost any character, depending on language scripts).
  * This fundamentally changes what the "longest unbreakable string" is for the purpose of `min-content` calculation. If you can break a word after *every character*, then the "longest unbreakable string" is effectively reduced to **a single character (or the width of the widest character)**.

**Reinterpreting "content strings must be as long as possible" in this context:**

The phrase "content strings must be as long as possible" in the authors' context, when `width` is `min-content` *and* `overflow-wrap: break-word` is applied, is a bit counter-intuitive. It likely refers to the fact that even with `break-word`, the browser will *still try* to make lines as long as possible *before* breaking a word.

However, the **actual practical impact on `min-content` is that it allows the element to become incredibly narrow.**

**Here's the clearer explanation of the calculation:**

1.  **Without `overflow-wrap: break-word`:** `min-content` for a `<div>` containing "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" would be the full width of that entire word. The browser cannot break it.
2.  **With `overflow-wrap: break-word`:** `min-content` for that same `<div>` becomes much, much smaller. Why? Because the browser is now told it *can* break that long word anywhere. For `min-content` calculation, it considers the narrowest possible valid layout. Since every character can be a break point, the element can theoretically be as narrow as **the widest single character** within its text content. It can lay out the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" like this:
    ```
    s
    u
    p
    e
    r
    ...
    s
    ```
    This makes the `min-content` width extremely small.

**In essence:**

The "minimum content" calculation, when `overflow-wrap: break-word` is active, assumes that content strings *can be made as short as necessary* (down to single characters) to achieve the most compact layout. The author's phrase "as long as possible" might be talking about the normal desire to fit as much on a line as possible *before* breaking, but for the `min-content` calculation itself, `break-word` means the content can effectively be "broken" into very short pieces if needed for minimal width.
