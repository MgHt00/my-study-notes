| --- | granular dependency injection | Why Granular Dependency Injection is Good: <ul><li> Explicitness: Each function clearly states what it depends on.</li> <li> Reduced Coupling: Modules don't become overly dependent on each other.</li> <li> Testability: As we've seen, testing is greatly improved.</li> <li> Maintainability: Code is easier to change and refactor.</li> </ul> The principle of granular dependency injection says, "Only pass what's explicitly needed."|
