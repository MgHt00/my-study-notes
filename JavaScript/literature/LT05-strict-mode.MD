JavaScript’s strict mode is a way to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in your code. When you use strict mode, JavaScript applies a set of rules that help you write cleaner, more secure, and more efficient code by catching common mistakes and potentially unsafe actions.

### How to Enable Strict Mode

You can enable strict mode by adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of a script or a function:

```javascript
"use strict"; // Entire script runs in strict mode

function example() {
  "use strict"; // Only this function runs in strict mode
}
```

### What Strict Mode Does

1. **Prevents Silent Errors**:
   - Without strict mode, certain actions that are problematic (like assigning to an undeclared variable) fail silently. In strict mode, these actions throw errors, helping catch potential bugs early.
   
   ```javascript
   "use strict";
   myVar = 10; // Throws an error since `myVar` is not declared
   ```

2. **Eliminates Some Unsafe Features**:
   - It disallows certain JavaScript features that can lead to confusing code, like `with` statements. 
   
   ```javascript
   "use strict";
   with (Math) { // Throws an error
     console.log(sin(90));
   }
   ```

3. **Restricts `this` Keyword**:
   - In non-strict mode, `this` can sometimes refer to the global object (like `window` in browsers) if used in a function that isn't part of an object. In strict mode, `this` will be `undefined` in such cases, making your intentions clearer.
   
   ```javascript
   "use strict";
   function test() {
     console.log(this); // `undefined` in strict mode, instead of global object
   }
   test();
   ```

4. **Forbids Duplicates**:
   - Strict mode disallows having multiple parameters with the same name in function declarations, as well as duplicate property names in objects.
   
   ```javascript
   "use strict";
   function duplicateParam(a, a) { // Throws an error
     return a;
   }
   ```

5. **Forbids Deleting Un-deletable Properties**:
   - In strict mode, attempting to delete non-configurable properties (e.g., built-in object properties) results in an error.
   
   ```javascript
   "use strict";
   delete Object.prototype; // Throws an error
   ```

### Benefits of Using Strict Mode

- **Improved Performance**: Some JavaScript engines can optimize code better when in strict mode.
- **Error Prevention**: You get warnings about certain mistakes immediately, helping to avoid hard-to-debug errors later.
- **Cleaner Code**: Enforcing stricter rules leads to more predictable, maintainable, and robust code.

Strict mode is commonly used in production code because it encourages good programming practices and catches errors early, making it an excellent habit to get into when writing JavaScript.

Yes, using strict mode is generally a best practice, especially in larger or more complex projects. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling, which helps catch common coding mistakes early. Here are a few reasons why it’s beneficial:

1. **Safer Variable Usage**: It prevents the use of undeclared variables, reducing accidental global variables.
2. **Easier Debugging**: Mistakes that normally would fail silently now throw errors, making them easier to catch.
3. **Reserved Keywords**: It reserves future JavaScript keywords, which avoids potential conflicts with new JavaScript features.

However, strict mode is enforced by default in modules (with `type="module"` in HTML). For older scripts, adding `"use strict";` at the top of your code is a simple and effective way to increase code reliability.
