Function scope and block scope are essential concepts in JavaScript, especially for understanding where variables and functions can be accessed within your code.

### 1. **Function Scope**
   - In JavaScript, a **function scope** means that variables declared within a function are accessible only inside that function and not outside.
   - **Function scope** applies to variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` if they are inside a function.
   - Functions also create a new scope, so any variable declared inside a function won’t be accessible from outside that function, providing a way to encapsulate logic and prevent variable conflicts.
  
   ```javascript
   function greet() {
       var message = "Hello!";
       console.log(message); // "Hello!"
   }
   greet();
   console.log(message); // ReferenceError: message is not defined
   ```

### 2. **Block Scope**
   - A **block** in JavaScript is any code wrapped in curly braces `{ }`, like in `if` statements, loops, and `{ }` blocks.
   - In **block scope**, variables declared with `let` and `const` are confined to the block where they are declared. They won’t be accessible outside the block, even if it’s within the same function or script.
   - Block scope is unique to variables declared with `let` and `const`; `var` declarations do not respect block scope and are instead hoisted to the nearest function scope.

   ```javascript
   if (true) {
       let message = "Inside block";
       console.log(message); // "Inside block"
   }
   console.log(message); // ReferenceError: message is not defined

   // `var` ignores block scope:
   if (true) {
       var globalMessage = "Inside block";
   }
   console.log(globalMessage); // "Inside block" because `var` does not obey block scope
   ```

### Key Differences

| Scope Type       | Applies To                        | Accessible Outside the Block?    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Function Scope   | Variables declared with `var`, `let`, `const` inside functions | **No**, only accessible within the function. |
| Block Scope      | Variables declared with `let`, `const` inside any `{ }` block | **No**, only accessible within the block. |
| Global Scope     | Variables declared outside of all functions and blocks | **Yes**, accessible throughout the entire script. |

### Why Use Function and Block Scope?

- **Function scope** is good for creating reusable functions without polluting the global scope.
- **Block scope** helps ensure that variables are restricted to the specific block they’re declared in, reducing potential conflicts in loops or conditionals.
