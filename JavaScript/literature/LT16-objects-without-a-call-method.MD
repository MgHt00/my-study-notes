In JavaScript, functions are special objects that include a `call` method, which is what makes them "callable." This `call` method essentially allows the function to be invoked. Other objects in JavaScript, like arrays, objects, or numbers, do not have this `call` method by default, which is why they aren’t callable.

When we try to call an object that isn’t a function, JavaScript looks for a `call` method, doesn’t find one, and throws a `TypeError`. Here’s a bit more detail on how this works and some examples to illustrate:

1. **Function Objects vs. Regular Objects**: A function in JavaScript is an object that has a `call` method, allowing it to be executed as `f()` or `f.call()`. Regular objects (e.g., `{}`, arrays, numbers) do not have this `call` method.

   ```javascript
   let f = function(x) { return x + 2; };
   console.log(typeof f);  // "function"
   console.log(f.call);    // Shows the call method for a function
   ```

2. **Regular Objects Lacking `call`**: If we attempt to call an object without a `call` method, like an array or a plain object, we get an error. This is because JavaScript tries to execute the `call` method, finds it’s missing, and throws a `TypeError`.

   ```javascript
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   arr(10);  // TypeError: arr is not a function
   
   let obj = { a: 1 };
   obj(10);  // TypeError: obj is not a function
   ```

3. **Optional Chaining with `?.` and Function Calls**: Optional chaining (`?.`) is helpful in situations where you aren’t certain if a variable is `null`, `undefined`, or has a `call` method. It short-circuits the call if the variable is `null` or `undefined`. However, if the variable is defined but isn’t a function, you’ll still see a `TypeError`.

   ```javascript
   let maybeFunc;
   maybeFunc?.();  // Safely does nothing because maybeFunc is undefined

   maybeFunc = {};
   maybeFunc?.();  // TypeError: maybeFunc is not a function
   ```

In summary, objects without a `call` method can’t be invoked as functions, and using optional chaining (`?.`) only helps avoid errors if the object is `null` or `undefined`. If it’s a defined, non-callable object, a `TypeError` will still occur when you try to call it like a function.
