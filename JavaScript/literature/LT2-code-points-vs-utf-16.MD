The reason the loop runs **three times** in the example `"I (love emoji) (dog emoji)"` string is because **JavaScript's `for/of` loop iterates over Unicode code points** rather than the individual UTF-16 characters that make up those code points. 

### Explanation of Code Points vs. UTF-16:

1. **Code Points**:
   - A code point is a single unit of a character in Unicode. Each Unicode character, such as a letter, number, or emoji, has a unique code point.
   - Unicode code points are not all the same size in terms of how they're stored in memory. Some Unicode characters can be represented with a single UTF-16 character (16-bit unit), but **others (like emojis or characters from certain languages) require two UTF-16 characters**.

2. **UTF-16**:
   - JavaScript uses UTF-16 encoding internally. Some characters are simple and fit in one 16-bit code unit (UTF-16 character), while others (like emojis) require **two 16-bit code units**.

3. **For/of Iteration**:
   - The `for/of` loop iterates over the **code points** of a string. This means each iteration retrieves one "character" as it would appear to a user (i.e., a full Unicode character, not just one UTF-16 unit).

### Breaking Down the Example:

- The string `"I (love emoji) (dog emoji)"` has three **code points**:
  1. The letter **"I"** is a single code point and requires one UTF-16 character.
  2. The **"love emoji"** (‚ù§Ô∏è or üß° depending on the emoji) is a single code point but requires **two UTF-16 characters**.
  3. The **"dog emoji"** (üê∂ or any other emoji) is another single code point but also requires **two UTF-16 characters**.

When you iterate through the string with a `for/of` loop, the loop recognizes each code point as a single entity, regardless of how many UTF-16 characters are used to represent it. That's why the loop runs **three times**‚Äîonce for each code point.

### Example in Code:

```javascript
let str = "I ‚ù§Ô∏è üê∂";  // "I love emoji dog emoji"

for (let char of str) {
    console.log(char);  // Logs: "I", "‚ù§Ô∏è", "üê∂"
}
```

This loop will run **three times**:
1. First iteration: Logs `"I"`.
2. Second iteration: Logs the heart emoji `"‚ù§Ô∏è"`.
3. Third iteration: Logs the dog emoji `"üê∂"`.

Even though the emojis each require two UTF-16 characters, they are treated as single code points, so the `for/of` loop only runs once for each of them. This is why the loop body runs three times in total.
