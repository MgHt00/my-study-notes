In JavaScript, **instance methods** and **static methods** serve different purposes and are associated with different contexts within a class.

### 1. Instance Methods

Instance methods are methods that are available on instances of a class. When you create an instance of a class, you have access to all the instance methods defined in that class. These methods operate on the data specific to each instance.

#### Example of Instance Methods
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  // Instance method
  start() {
    console.log(`Starting ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
  }
}

let myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
myCar.start(); // "Starting Toyota Corolla"
```

Here:
- `start()` is an **instance method** because it’s meant to be used by individual instances of the `Car` class.
- When we create `myCar`, an instance of `Car`, `myCar` can use `start()` because it’s an instance method.

### 2. Static Methods

Static methods, on the other hand, belong to the class itself, not to instances. They’re useful for utility functions or actions that are related to the class but don’t operate on any particular instance. To define a static method, you use the `static` keyword before the method.

#### Example of Static Methods
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  static isCar(obj) {
    return obj instanceof Car;
  }
}

let myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
console.log(Car.isCar(myCar)); // true
console.log(myCar.isCar); // undefined
```

Here:
- `isCar` is a **static method** of the `Car` class. It checks whether an object is an instance of `Car`.
- `Car.isCar(myCar)` works because `isCar` is defined as a static method on `Car`.
- `myCar.isCar` would be `undefined` because static methods are not available on instances.

### Summary: Key Differences

- **Access**:
  - Instance methods are accessed on instances of the class (e.g., `myCar.start()`).
  - Static methods are accessed on the class itself (e.g., `Car.isCar()`).
  
- **Purpose**:
  - Instance methods work with specific instance data and behaviors.
  - Static methods perform class-level actions or checks, often without needing an instance.

- **Inheritance**:
  - When you create subclasses, both instance methods and static methods are inherited, but they’re accessed differently:
    - Instance methods are inherited on instances of the subclass.
    - Static methods are inherited on the subclass itself.

### In Practice: When to Use Each

- Use **instance methods** when you need to operate on individual objects of a class.
- Use **static methods** for utility functions or when you need logic that applies to the class as a whole, rather than to specific instances.

By distinguishing between these, you can structure code to make it clear what applies to individual objects versus what applies to the class overall. This organization can also make your code more reusable and easier to understand.
