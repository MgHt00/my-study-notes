Great question! The terms *property* and *attribute* can be confusing in JavaScript, but here’s the key difference:

### **1. Object's Property**
A **property** is a named value stored in an object. It can be a simple value, a method (function), or even another object.

Example:
```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Win Htoo Shwe",
  age: 25
};

console.log(obj.name);  // "Win Htoo Shwe"
console.log(obj.age);   // 25
```
Here, `name` and `age` are **properties** of `obj`.

### **2. Object's Attribute**
An **attribute** is metadata about a property. JavaScript properties have **attributes** that define how they behave. The three key property attributes are:

1. **writable** – Can the property be changed?
2. **enumerable** – Will the property show up in loops?
3. **configurable** – Can the property be deleted or changed?

Example of checking a property’s attributes:
```javascript
const obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, "name", {
  value: "Win Htoo Shwe",
  writable: false,    // Cannot be changed
  enumerable: false,  // Won't show in loops
  configurable: false // Cannot be deleted or redefined
});

console.log(obj.name); // "Win Htoo Shwe"

obj.name = "New Name"; 
console.log(obj.name); // Still "Win Htoo Shwe" because writable is false

console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // [] because enumerable is false
```
Here, `name` is a **property**, but its **attributes** (`writable`, `enumerable`, `configurable`) control how it behaves.

---

### **How Does This Relate to Prototypes?**
When dealing with prototypes, every object has a hidden `[[Prototype]]` attribute, which is not a normal property but an internal link to another object.

Example:
```javascript
const parent = { greeting: "Hello" };
const child = Object.create(parent);

console.log(child.greeting); // "Hello" (inherited from prototype)

console.log(child.hasOwnProperty("greeting")); // false, because it’s from the prototype
```
Here:
- `greeting` is a **property** of `parent`.
- `child` does not have a `greeting` property, but it inherits it via its `[[Prototype]]` **attribute**.

---

### **Summary Table**
| Term            | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Property**   | A named value in an object (e.g., `obj.name`) |
| **Attribute**  | Metadata that controls how a property behaves (e.g., `writable`, `enumerable`, `configurable`) |
| **Prototype Attribute (`[[Prototype]]`)** | The hidden reference to another object that allows inheritance |
