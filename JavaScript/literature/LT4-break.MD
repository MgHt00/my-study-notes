# break

The `break` statement in JavaScript is used to **terminate a loop or switch statement** before it has finished all of its iterations or cases. When a `break` statement is encountered, the loop or switch is immediately exited, and the program continues executing the next statement following the loop or switch.

### Where is `break` used?
1. **In `switch` statements**
2. **In loops** (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)

### 1. Using `break` in `switch` statements
In a `switch` statement, `break` is used to exit the `switch` after a particular case has been executed, preventing the code from "falling through" to the next case.

#### Example:
```javascript
let fruit = "apple";

switch (fruit) {
    case "banana":
        console.log("Banana selected");
        break;
    case "apple":
        console.log("Apple selected");
        break;  // The `break` statement stops further cases from running.
    case "orange":
        console.log("Orange selected");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown fruit");
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `switch` checks for the matching case.
- Once it finds the matching case (`apple` in this example), it executes the code in that block.
- The `break` statement ensures that after executing the code for the matching case, the `switch` is exited. Without `break`, the program would continue executing all subsequent cases, which is usually not desired.

### 2. Using `break` in Loops
In loops, `break` is used to exit the loop early, without completing all iterations.

#### Example 1: `for` loop with `break`
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    if (i === 2) {
        break;  // Exit the loop once `i` equals 2
    }
}
console.log("Loop ended");
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
Loop ended
```

**Explanation:**
- The `for` loop starts and prints the numbers 0, 1, and 2.
- When `i === 2`, the `break` statement is executed, which terminates the loop early.
- As a result, the numbers 3 and 4 are **not printed**, and the program moves on to the next line after the loop.

#### Example 2: `while` loop with `break`
```javascript
let count = 0;

while (count < 10) {
    console.log(count);
    if (count === 5) {
        break;  // Exit the loop when `count` is 5
    }
    count++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

**Explanation:**
- The `while` loop runs as long as `count < 10`.
- The loop prints the values of `count` from 0 to 5.
- When `count` reaches 5, the `break` statement is executed, and the loop terminates early, even though the condition (`count < 10`) was still true.

### Key Points to Remember:
1. **In `switch` statements**: `break` is used to stop the execution of subsequent cases.
2. **In loops**: `break` stops the loop from iterating any further, regardless of the loop's condition.
3. Without `break` in a `switch`, all cases after the matching case would execute (this is called "fallthrough").
4. `break` immediately stops the loop, skipping any remaining iterations.

Let’s dive into **nested loops** and how the `break` statement interacts with them. In **nested loops**, a `break` statement only exits the loop where the `break` is encountered, not the outer loop. To exit multiple nested loops, other techniques are needed, such as using labels.

### Example 1: Basic Nested Loops with `break`
In this example, we have two loops: an outer `for` loop and an inner `for` loop. The `break` only exits the inner loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("Outer loop i:", i);
    
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (j === 1) {
            break;  // Exit the inner loop when j equals 1
        }
        console.log("  Inner loop j:", j);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Outer loop i: 0
  Inner loop j: 0
Outer loop i: 1
  Inner loop j: 0
Outer loop i: 2
  Inner loop j: 0
```

**Explanation:**
- The outer loop runs for `i = 0`, `1`, and `2`.
- Inside the outer loop, the inner loop starts. But when `j` becomes `1`, the `break` statement exits **only** the inner loop, and the outer loop continues to the next iteration.
- As a result, the inner loop only logs `j = 0` for each `i` value.

### Example 2: Nested Loops with `break` and Labels
To exit both the inner and outer loops simultaneously, we can use **labels**. A label in JavaScript is an identifier followed by a colon (`:`), and it allows you to specify which loop you want to break out of.

#### Example with Label:
```javascript
outerLoop:  // Label for the outer loop
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("Outer loop i:", i);
    
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (j === 1) {
            break outerLoop;  // Exit both inner and outer loops
        }
        console.log("  Inner loop j:", j);
    }
}
console.log("Both loops terminated.");
```

**Output:**
```
Outer loop i: 0
  Inner loop j: 0
Both loops terminated.
```

**Explanation:**
- The outer loop starts with `i = 0`, and the inner loop starts with `j = 0`.
- When `j` becomes `1`, the `break outerLoop` statement is encountered.
- This breaks **both** the inner and outer loops because of the label `outerLoop`.
- The loops terminate immediately, and "Both loops terminated." is printed.

### Example 3: `break` in a More Complex Nested Loop
Let’s consider a scenario where we want to search for a specific value in a two-dimensional array. Once the value is found, we can break out of both loops.

```javascript
let matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];

let found = false;

outer:  // Label for the outer loop
for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        if (matrix[i][j] === 5) {
            found = true;
            console.log(`Found 5 at position (${i}, ${j})`);
            break outer;  // Exit both loops once the number 5 is found
        }
    }
}

if (!found) {
    console.log("5 was not found in the matrix.");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Found 5 at position (1, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
- We loop through each row (`i`) and each element in the row (`j`) to search for the number `5`.
- Once `matrix[i][j] === 5`, the `break outer` statement is executed, and both loops terminate.
- If the number `5` were not found, the message "5 was not found" would be printed, but in this case, it was found at position (1, 1).

### Without Labels
Without using labels, breaking the outer loop would require using additional logic, like using a boolean flag:

```javascript
let found = false;

for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        if (matrix[i][j] === 5) {
            found = true;
            console.log(`Found 5 at position (${i}, ${j})`);
            break;  // Break only the inner loop
        }
    }
    if (found) {
        break;  // Break the outer loop after exiting the inner one
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `break` statement exits the inner loop when `5` is found.
- After that, the outer loop checks if `found` is `true`, and if so, breaks as well.

### Summary
- **Without labels**, `break` only exits the inner loop, not the outer loop in nested loops.
- **With labels**, you can specify which loop to break out of, allowing you to break multiple loops at once.
- Labels should be used sparingly since they can make code harder to read. But in cases of complex loop control (like nested loops), they are a useful tool.
