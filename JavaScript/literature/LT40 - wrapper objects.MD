[G] Absolutely! The term "wrapper object" refers to a special type of object in JavaScript that's used to represent primitive values (like numbers, strings, or booleans) as objects.
Here's a breakdown:
Primitive Values vs. Objects:
 * Primitive Values:
   * These are basic data types that are not objects and have no methods or properties (e.g., 10, "hello", true).
   * They are immutable (their values cannot be changed).
 * Objects:
   * These are complex data types that can have properties and methods.
   * They are mutable (their properties can be changed).
The Need for Wrapper Objects:
JavaScript sometimes needs to treat primitive values as if they were objects. This happens in situations like:
 * Accessing Properties or Methods: Primitive values don't have properties or methods. However, JavaScript allows you to access properties or methods on primitive values as if they were objects.
 * Automatic Boxing: When you try to access a property or method on a primitive value, JavaScript automatically creates a temporary wrapper object for that primitive value. This process is called "boxing."
Types of Wrapper Objects:
JavaScript has three main wrapper object types:
 * Number: Used to represent numeric values as objects.
 * String: Used to represent string values as objects.
 * Boolean: Used to represent boolean values as objects.
Example:
const str = "hello";

// Accessing a property (length) on a primitive string:
console.log(str.length); // Output: 5

// Internally, JavaScript does something like this:
// const tempWrapper = new String(str);
// console.log(tempWrapper.length);
// tempWrapper is then discarded.

// Creating a wrapper object explicitly:
const strObj = new String("world");
console.log(strObj.length); // Output: 5

Key Points:
 * Wrapper objects are created automatically when you access properties or methods on primitive values.
 * They provide a way to treat primitive values as objects temporarily.
 * Explicitly creating wrapper objects is generally discouraged, as it can lead to unexpected behavior.
Why Avoid Explicit Wrapper Objects?
 * Type Coercion: Explicitly creating wrapper objects can sometimes lead to unexpected type coercion. For example, new Boolean(false) is an object, and objects are truthy in JavaScript.
 * Performance: There is a slight performance overhead when creating wrapper objects, although it is usually negligible.
 * Readability: It is more common and readable to use the primitive values directly.
In most cases, you don't need to worry about wrapper objects explicitly. JavaScript handles them automatically behind the scenes.
