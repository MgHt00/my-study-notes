[G] You're very welcome, and that's a fantastic question! It's a fundamental concept in programming, and it's great that you're digging into it.

**Why Pass Objects by Reference Instead of Using Global Variables?**

While it's true that objects are passed by reference, using global variables instead of passing objects as arguments is generally considered bad practice. Here's why:

1.  **Scope and Encapsulation:**
    * **Global Variables:** Are accessible from anywhere in your code. This means any part of your code can modify them, leading to unpredictable behavior and making it difficult to track down bugs.
    * **Function Arguments:** Limit the scope of the object to the function. This makes your code more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to unintended side effects. It's called encapsulation.

2.  **Maintainability and Readability:**
    * **Global Variables:** Make your code harder to maintain and read. You have to keep track of all the places where the global variable might be modified.
    * **Function Arguments:** Make your code more self-contained. You can see exactly what data a function needs by looking at its parameters.

3.  **Testability:**
    * **Global Variables:** Make your code harder to test. You have to set up the global state before running your tests, and your tests might interfere with each other.
    * **Function Arguments:** Make your code easier to test. You can pass in different objects to your function and test its behavior in isolation.

4.  **Avoiding Naming Conflicts:**
    * **Global Variables:** Increase the risk of naming conflicts, especially in large projects with multiple developers.
    * **Function Arguments:** Avoid naming conflicts by keeping variables within the function's scope.

5.  **Reusability:**
    * **Global Variables:** Make your functions less reusable. They become tightly coupled to the global state.
    * **Function Arguments:** Make your functions more reusable. They can work with different objects, making them more versatile.

6.  **Predictability:**
    * **Global Variables:** Make your code less predictable. It's harder to reason about how a function will behave because it depends on the global state.
    * **Function Arguments:** Make your code more predictable. You can understand how a function will behave based on its inputs.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Bad practice: Using a global variable
let globalData = { count: 0 };

function incrementGlobalCount() {
  globalData.count++;
}

// Good practice: Passing an object as an argument
function incrementCount(data) {
  data.count++;
}

let localData = { count: 0 };
incrementCount(localData);
```

In the good practice example, the `incrementCount` function is more flexible and easier to test because it doesn't depend on a global variable.

**In essence:**

Passing objects by reference as function arguments promotes better code organization, maintainability, testability, and reusability. It's a fundamental principle of good programming practices.
