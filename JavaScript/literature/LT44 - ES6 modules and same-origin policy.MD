[G] Yes, in most cases, you **do need a local web server** to properly run ES6 modules (using `<script type="module">`).

Here's why:

**Same-Origin Policy:**

  * ES6 modules rely on the same-origin security policy. This policy restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.
  * When you open an HTML file directly from your file system (using `file://` protocol), the browser treats it as a different origin than other files on your system. This can lead to security restrictions and prevent modules from loading correctly.

**Module Resolution:**

  * ES6 modules use relative or absolute URLs to import other modules.
  * Browsers need a proper HTTP server to resolve these URLs correctly.
  * When you open an HTML file directly, the browser might not be able to resolve the module URLs correctly.

**Why a Local Server Helps:**

  * **HTTP Protocol:** A local web server serves your files using the HTTP protocol (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/`). This satisfies the same-origin policy and allows modules to load correctly.
  * **MIME Types:** A web server also sets the correct MIME types for your files, which is essential for modules to be interpreted properly.
  * **Module Resolution:** The server correctly resolves module URLs, ensuring that your modules can find and import each other.

**Ways to Set Up a Local Web Server:**

1.  **Node.js and `http-server`:**

      * Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://nodejs.org/).
      * Install `http-server`: Open your terminal and run `npm install -g http-server`.
      * Run the server: Navigate to your project directory and run `http-server`.
      * Access your files: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.

2.  **VS Code Live Server Extension:**

      * If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension.
      * Open your HTML file in VS Code.
      * Click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner.

3.  **Python's Built-in Server:**

      * If you have Python installed, navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
      * Run `python -m http.server` (Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2).
      * Access your files: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.

4.  **Other Local Servers:**

      * There are many other local web servers available, such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.

**In summary:**

While it might sometimes seem to work in simple cases, relying on opening HTML files directly from the file system is not a reliable way to work with ES6 modules. Using a local web server is the recommended approach to ensure that your modules load and function correctly.
