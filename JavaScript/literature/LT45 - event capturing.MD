[G] Yes, let's explore "event capturing," a crucial part of the JavaScript event model.

**Understanding Event Propagation**

When an event occurs on a nested element, it doesn't just happen on that specific element. It propagates through the DOM tree. There are three phases of event propagation:

1.  **Capturing Phase:** The event travels down the DOM tree from the window to the target element.
2.  **Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element.
3.  **Bubbling Phase:** The event travels back up the DOM tree from the target element to the window.

**Event Capturing Explained**

* **Top-Down Flow:**
    * In the capturing phase, the event starts at the `window` object and travels down through each ancestor element of the target element.
    * It's like the event is "capturing" the elements on its way down.
* **Purpose:**
    * Event capturing allows you to intercept and handle events before they reach their target element.
    * This can be useful for implementing global event handling or for performing actions based on the event's path.
* **`addEventListener()` and Capturing:**
    * You can register an event listener for the capturing phase by setting the third argument of `addEventListener()` to `true`.
    * The syntax is: `element.addEventListener(eventType, handler, true);`

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Event Capturing</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="outer">
    <div id="inner">
      <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script>
    const outer = document.getElementById("outer");
    const inner = document.getElementById("inner");
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

    // Capturing phase listeners
    outer.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Outer capturing");
    }, true);

    inner.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Inner capturing");
    }, true);

    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Button target");
    }); // Bubble phase by default.

    // Bubbling phase listeners.
    outer.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Outer bubbling");
    }, false);

    inner.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Inner bubbling");
    }, false);

  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Capturing Listeners:**
    * We register click event listeners on the `outer` and `inner` divs with the third argument set to `true`, indicating that they should listen during the capturing phase.
2.  **Target Listener:**
    * We register a click event listener on the `button` element (default bubbling phase).
3.  **Bubbling Listeners:**
    * We register click event listeners on the `outer` and `inner` divs with the third argument set to `false`, or omitted, indicating that they should listen during the bubbling phase.
4.  **Event Flow:**
    * When you click the button, the event flow will be:
        1.  **Capturing:** `outer` (capturing), `inner` (capturing)
        2.  **Target:** `button` (target)
        3.  **Bubbling:** `inner` (bubbling), `outer` (bubbling)
5.  **Console Output:**

    ```
    Outer capturing
    Inner capturing
    Button target
    Inner bubbling
    Outer bubbling
    ```

**Key Points:**

* Event capturing allows you to handle events before they reach their target.
* It's useful for global event handling and intercepting events.
* Use the third argument of `addEventListener()` to specify capturing (`true`) or bubbling (`false`).
* In most cases, event bubbling is more commonly used than event capturing.
