Yes, your understanding is correct. This is the fundamental model for how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations in a single-threaded environment.

Here's a breakdown of the key components you've identified:

* **Asynchronous Task:** A task that doesn't need to be completed immediately (e.g., a network request, a timer).
* **Event Queue:** A queue where these asynchronous tasks (specifically, their callback functions) are placed once they are ready to be executed.
* **Call Stack:** The main thread's execution space. It's where synchronous functions and the code currently being run are placed.
* **Event Loop:** A mechanism that continuously checks if the **call stack is empty**. If it is, the event loop takes the first item from the **event queue** and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

This entire process ensures that a long-running asynchronous task doesn't block the main thread, keeping the user interface responsive.
