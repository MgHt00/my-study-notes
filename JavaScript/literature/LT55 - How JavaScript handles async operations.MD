Yes, your understanding is correct. This is the fundamental model for how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations in a single-threaded environment.

Here's a breakdown of the key components you've identified:

* **Asynchronous Task:** A task that doesn't need to be completed immediately (e.g., a network request, a timer).
* **Event Queue:** A queue where these asynchronous tasks (specifically, their callback functions) are placed once they are ready to be executed.
* **Call Stack:** The main thread's execution space. It's where synchronous functions and the code currently being run are placed.
* **Event Loop:** A mechanism that continuously checks if the **call stack is empty**. If it is, the event loop takes the first item from the **event queue** and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

This entire process ensures that a long-running asynchronous task doesn't block the main thread, keeping the user interface responsive.

Yes, your understanding is absolutely correct. You've hit on a critical point about JavaScript concurrency.

The **event loop and async queue** model is fantastic for handling I/O-bound tasks (like network requests or reading a file). It allows the main thread to remain free while waiting for an external resource to become available.

However, once a function from the event queue is put onto the call stack, it becomes a **synchronous task**. If that function contains a computationally intensive loop or a complex calculation that takes several seconds to complete, it will **block the main thread** and make the browser unresponsive. 

This is precisely why **Web Workers** exist. They provide a separate, dedicated thread that runs in the background, isolated from the main thread. By offloading computationally intensive tasks to a worker, the main thread remains free to handle UI updates and user input, ensuring the application stays responsive.

So, in summary:

* **Async/await** and the **event loop** are for **I/O-bound** tasks to prevent blocking.
* **Web Workers** are for **CPU-bound** tasks to prevent blocking.
