When using classes, you have two primary methods for creating a new object: **instantiation** and **extension**. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages.

-----

### 1\. Instantiation (Creating an instance from the Class)

This is the most direct way to create an object from a class using the `new` keyword.

**Pros:**

  * **Simplicity and Clarity**: It's the most straightforward and common way to use a class. The code is easy to read and understand.
  * **Encapsulation**: The new instance encapsulates its own state, completely separate from other instances of the same class. Changes to one instance won't affect another.
  * **Memory Efficiency**: Instantiation is a lightweight process that only allocates memory for the properties and methods of the new object.

**Cons:**

  * **Limited Customization**: If you need to add new functionality or override existing methods, you cannot do so directly on the instance itself. You'd have to modify the original class or create a new class.

**Example:**

```javascript
class Car {
    constructor(make) { this.make = make; }
    drive() { console.log('Driving!'); }
}
const myCar = new Car('Toyota'); // Instantiation
myCar.drive();
```

### 2\. Extension (Inheritance)

This involves creating a new class (a subclass) that inherits from an existing class (a superclass) using the `extends` keyword. You then create an instance from this new, extended class.

**Pros:**

  * **Code Reusability**: You can reuse the properties and methods of the superclass without rewriting them. This is the main benefit of inheritance.
  * **Customization and Specialization**: You can easily add new properties and methods or override existing ones in the subclass. This is ideal for creating specialized versions of a general class (e.g., a `SportsCar` extending a `Car` class).
  * **Polymorphism**: The subclass can be used in the same context as the superclass, which is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming.

**Cons:**

  * **Complexity**: The code can become more complex due to the relationship between the superclass and subclass. It can be difficult to trace where a method or property is defined, especially with multiple levels of inheritance.
  * **Tightly Coupled Code**: Subclasses are tightly coupled to their superclasses. A change to the superclass can inadvertently break all its subclasses. This is often referred to as the "brittle base class" problem.
  * **Inheritance Hierarchy Issues**: It can be challenging to design a good inheritance hierarchy. Using inheritance for code reuse can lead to complex and rigid class structures that are hard to maintain.

**Example:**

```javascript
class Car {
    constructor(make) { this.make = make; }
    drive() { console.log('Driving!'); }
}
class SportsCar extends Car { // Extension
    constructor(make) {
        super(make);
        this.speed = 'Fast';
    }
    drive() {
        super.drive(); // Calling the superclass method
        console.log('Driving really fast!');
    }
    boost() { console.log('Boosting!'); }
}
const mySportsCar = new SportsCar('Ferrari'); // Instantiation from the extended class
mySportsCar.drive(); // Outputs "Driving!" and "Driving really fast!"
mySportsCar.boost();
```

### Conclusion

  * Choose **instantiation** when you simply need a new, independent object with the same behavior as the base class. It's the standard, go-to approach for creating objects.
  * Choose **extension** when you need to create a new, more specialized type of object that shares a core set of behaviors with a base class but also adds or modifies some of that behavior.
