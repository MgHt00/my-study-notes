The main difference between a standard string and a localized string is that a *localized string* is tailored to a specific language, region, or culture, while a *standard string* isn’t specific to any language or locale.

Here are some key distinctions:

### 1. **Definition and Purpose**
   - **Standard String**: A sequence of characters that represents text as-is without any specific formatting or language context.
   - **Localized String**: A string adapted to a specific locale. This means it’s translated or formatted to suit the language, cultural conventions, and regional settings of the intended audience.

### 2. **Usage**
   - **Standard String**: Typically used for fixed text that doesn’t need translation or adaptation to other regions.
   - **Localized String**: Used for text that varies based on the user's language or region. Localized strings allow apps and websites to display messages in different languages and formats according to user preferences.

### 3. **Formatting and Representation**
   - **Standard String**: Often displayed with default character formats and without specific date, time, currency, or number formatting.
   - **Localized String**: Can adapt character sets, date/time formats, and other cultural conventions. For example:
     - Numbers might be displayed as "1,234.56" in English and "1.234,56" in German.
     - Dates may show as "MM/DD/YYYY" in the U.S. but as "DD/MM/YYYY" in many other regions.

### 4. **Storage and Implementation**
   - **Standard String**: Stored as-is in the code or data source without special handling for language or format.
   - **Localized String**: Often stored in resource files or databases alongside translations. For example, JavaScript `Intl` API, Android `strings.xml` files, or `Localizable.strings` files in iOS make it easy to switch between languages.

### Example
For an English-speaking user, an app might display:
```plaintext
"Your total is $100.50."
```
For a German-speaking user in Germany, a localized string might display:
```plaintext
"Ihr Gesamtbetrag beträgt 100,50 €."
```
