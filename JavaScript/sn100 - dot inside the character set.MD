The regex `[\w.]+` can be broken down as follows:

1. **Character Set `[\w.]`:**
   - `\w`: Matches any **ASCII word character**, which includes letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`), digits (`0-9`), and the underscore (`_`).
   - `.` (inside the character set): Matches a literal dot (`.`), not the "any character" functionality it has outside a set.

   Together, `[\w.]` matches **any word character** or a **dot**.

2. **Quantifier `+`:**
   - Matches **one or more occurrences** of the preceding pattern (in this case, any character from `[\w.]`).

### Meaning
The regex `[\w.]+` matches **one or more sequences of ASCII word characters or dots**. It does **not** match any character arbitrarilyâ€”it is limited to word characters and dots.

---

### Examples
#### Matches:
- `"hello"`: All characters are word characters.
- `"hello.world"`: Matches the entire string, as both word characters and dots are allowed.
- `"file_name.v2"`: Matches the entire string, as underscores and dots are included.
- `"123.456"`: Matches, as numbers and dots are valid.

#### Does Not Match:
- `"hello-world"`: The `-` is not in the set `[\w.]`.
- `"hello!world"`: The `!` is not in the set `[\w.]`.

---

### Comparison with `.` Outside a Set
If you had `[\w]+` or just `.` (outside brackets):
- `[\w]+`: Matches one or more word characters, but does **not** allow dots.
- `.`: Matches **any single character**, except newline (when the `s` flag is not used). It is much broader in scope than `[\w.]`.

### Conclusion
The regex `[\w.]+` is specific to ASCII word characters and dots, ensuring only those characters repeat at least once in a match.
