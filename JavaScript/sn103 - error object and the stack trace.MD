The authors are highlighting a subtle but important detail about how JavaScript's stack trace works when dealing with error objects. Here's a breakdown to clarify their point:

### What They're Saying:
When an error is thrown using the `throw` keyword, the stack trace (the list of function calls leading up to the error) shows **where the error object was created** rather than the exact location of the `throw` statement itself.

This might seem confusing if you create the error object (`new Error()`) in one place but throw it in another. The stack trace will point to the creation of the error, not the `throw` statement.

### Example 1: Creating and Throwing Immediately
```javascript
function example() {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!"); // Create and throw the error here
}

example();
```
**Stack trace output:**
The stack trace clearly points to the line inside the `example()` function where the error was both **created** and **thrown**.

This is straightforward and causes no confusion because the error object is created right before it is thrown.

---

### Example 2: Creating and Throwing Separately
```javascript
function createError() {
  return new Error("Something went wrong!"); // Create the error here
}

function example() {
  const error = createError(); // Get the error object
  throw error; // Throw it here
}

example();
```
**Stack trace output:**
The stack trace will indicate the line in `createError()` where the error object was created, **not the line in `example()` where it was thrown**.

---

### Why This Matters
If you're debugging and see a stack trace that doesn't point to the `throw` statement, it can be misleading. You'll have to trace back to where the error object was created, which could be in a different function or even a different module.

---

### Best Practice
To avoid confusion, the authors recommend **always creating the error object immediately before throwing it**. For example:

```javascript
function example() {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!"); // Create and throw the error immediately
}
```

This ensures the stack trace accurately reflects where the problem occurred, making debugging easier.

---

### Summary
- The stack trace shows where the error object was **created**, not where it was **thrown**.
- If the two locations differ, debugging can become harder.
- To avoid this, create the error object (`new Error()`) right before you throw it (`throw`).
