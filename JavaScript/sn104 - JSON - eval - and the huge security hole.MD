The authors are explaining the relationship between JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and JavaScript, specifically emphasizing a potential security risk.

### What They're Saying:

1. **JSON as JavaScript Source Code**: 
   A JSON string is valid JavaScript source code for an expression. For example, a JSON representation of a data structure like this:

   ```json
   {"name":"Alice","age":25}
   ```

   is also valid JavaScript syntax for an object literal. If you were to evaluate this string as JavaScript code, it would create an object.

2. **`eval()` and JSON**: 
   If you prefix a JSON string with a variable declaration, such as:

   ```javascript
   var data = {"name":"Alice","age":25};
   ```

   and pass this to `eval()`, it evaluates the string as JavaScript code, creating a copy of the data structure.

3. **Why You Shouldn't Use `eval()`**:
   The authors strongly warn against this practice because `eval()` executes any JavaScript code in the string, not just valid JSON. This poses a **security risk** if the JSON string comes from an untrusted source, as malicious code could be executed. For example:

   ```javascript
   var data = eval('{"name":"Alice","age":25}; alert("Hacked!");');
   ```

   This evaluates to an object, but it also executes the malicious `alert("Hacked!")`.

### Secure Alternatives:

Instead of using `eval()`, always use `JSON.parse()` to safely parse a JSON string:

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":25}';
const data = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(data.name); // "Alice"
```

- `JSON.parse()` only parses valid JSON, so it avoids the risks associated with `eval()`.
- It ignores any non-JSON code, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.

---

### Summary:

The authors are cautioning against a historical practice where developers might misuse `eval()` to deserialize JSON strings. While this works technically, it is unsafe and unnecessary in modern JavaScript, given the existence of `JSON.parse()`. Always prefer `JSON.parse()` for JSON deserialization to ensure security and correctness.
