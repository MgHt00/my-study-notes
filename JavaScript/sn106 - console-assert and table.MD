Let's break down `console.assert()` and `console.table()` from the Console API:

### `console.assert()`
`console.assert()` is used to write an error message to the console if the provided expression evaluates to `false`. It takes two main arguments: 
- **Condition**: The first argument is the condition that you want to test. If this condition is `false`, the assertion fails.
- **Message**: The second argument (optional) is the message to display when the assertion fails.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.assert(2 + 2 === 4, 'This will not log.');
console.assert(2 + 2 === 5, 'This will log because the assertion failed.');
```
In the example, the second `console.assert()` will log the message `"This will log because the assertion failed."` because the condition `2 + 2 === 5` is `false`.

### `console.table()`
`console.table()` displays tabular data as a table in the console. It's particularly useful for visualizing arrays and objects in a structured format. Each element of the array or each property of the object will be a row in the table.

**Example with an array of objects:**
```javascript
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }
];
console.table(users);
```
This will display the `users` array in a tabular format in the console, showing the `name` and `age` properties as columns and each object as a row.

**Example with an object:**
```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
  city: 'Wonderland'
};
console.table(user);
```
This will display the `user` object as a table with `name`, `age`, and `city` as rows, showing their corresponding values.

These methods are excellent for debugging and visualizing data in a more readable format in the console. Would you like more detailed examples or explanations for either of these methods?
