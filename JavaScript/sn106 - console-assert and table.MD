Let's break down `console.assert()` and `console.table()` from the Console API:

### `console.assert()`
`console.assert()` is used to write an error message to the console if the provided expression evaluates to `false`. It takes two main arguments: 
- **Condition**: The first argument is the condition that you want to test. If this condition is `false`, the assertion fails.
- **Message**: The second argument (optional) is the message to display when the assertion fails.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.assert(2 + 2 === 4, 'This will not log.');
console.assert(2 + 2 === 5, 'This will log because the assertion failed.');
```
In the example, the second `console.assert()` will log the message `"This will log because the assertion failed."` because the condition `2 + 2 === 5` is `false`.

### `console.table()`
`console.table()` displays tabular data as a table in the console. It's particularly useful for visualizing arrays and objects in a structured format. Each element of the array or each property of the object will be a row in the table.

**Example with an array of objects:**
```javascript
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }
];
console.table(users);
```
This will display the `users` array in a tabular format in the console, showing the `name` and `age` properties as columns and each object as a row.

**Example with an object:**
```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
  city: 'Wonderland'
};
console.table(user);
```
This will display the `user` object as a table with `name`, `age`, and `city` as rows, showing their corresponding values.

These methods are excellent for debugging and visualizing data in a more readable format in the console. 

Here are examples for the two statements about `console.table()`:

### 1. Relatively Short Array of Objects
`console.table()` works best with arrays of objects where each object has a similar structure and a small number of properties. Here's an example:

```javascript
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, city: "San Francisco" },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, city: "Los Angeles" }
];

console.table(people);
```

In this example, each object in the `people` array has the same set of properties (`name`, `age`, and `city`). This structure makes it easy for `console.table()` to display the data in a clear and concise tabular format.

### 2. Array of Property Names as Optional Second Argument
You can specify which properties (columns) you want to include in the table by passing an array of property names as the second argument. Here's an example:

```javascript
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, city: "San Francisco" },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, city: "Los Angeles" }
];

// Only display the 'name' and 'city' columns
console.table(people, ["name", "city"]);
```

In this example, the table will only display the `name` and `city` columns, ignoring the `age` property. This is useful when you want to focus on specific pieces of information.

These examples demonstrate how `console.table()` can be used effectively to display structured data in the console.
