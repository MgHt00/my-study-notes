`console.count()` is a useful tool for counting the number of times a specific label is logged. This can be particularly helpful in debugging scenarios, such as keeping track of how often an event handler is triggered.

### Example 1: Counting Button Clicks

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.count("Button clicked");
});
```

In this example, every time the button is clicked, `console.count("Button clicked")` logs how many times the event handler has been executed with the label "Button clicked."

### Example 2: Counting API Calls

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  console.count("API call");
  // Simulate an API call
}

fetchData();
fetchData();
fetchData();
```

Here, each time `fetchData` is called, it increments the count for the label "API call," helping you track the number of API requests made.

### Example 3: Multiple Labels

```javascript
function logEvent(eventName) {
  console.count(eventName);
}

logEvent("page load");
logEvent("page load");
logEvent("button click");
logEvent("button click");
logEvent("button click");
```

In this example, different event types (e.g., "page load" and "button click") are counted separately using their respective labels. This helps in distinguishing between various events.

These examples illustrate how `console.count()` can be used to monitor and debug the frequency of certain actions in your code.
