The authors are describing the behavior of `console.log()` (and similar methods) when a format string is used. A format string allows you to include placeholders in the output, which are replaced by the values of subsequent arguments. Here are the key placeholders and their purposes:

- `%s`: String
- `%i` or `%d`: Integer
- `%f`: Floating-point number
- `%o`: Object with generic JavaScript object formatting
- `%O`: Object with more detailed formatting
- `%c`: Applies CSS styles to the log (for supported browsers)

### Example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello %s, you have %d unread messages.", "Alice", 5);
```

- `%s` is replaced by "Alice".
- `%d` is replaced by `5`.

### Example with `%c`:

```javascript
console.log("%cThis is a styled message", "color: blue; font-size: 20px");
```

- `%c` allows applying CSS styles to the log message, making "This is a styled message" appear in blue and with a larger font size.

These format specifiers are a convenient way to format the output dynamically and make the logs more informative.

Using `console.log()` with format specifiers like `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%f`, `%o`, `%O`, and `%c` helps in formatting the output more dynamically and readably. Here's why it's useful:

1. **Dynamic Data Formatting**: It allows you to insert dynamic values into a fixed string template, making the output clearer and more descriptive without concatenating strings and variables manually.
   
2. **Improved Readability**: The output is cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with multiple variables in a single log statement.

3. **Type Specificity**: By using specific format specifiers, you can control the type of formatting, such as decimal places for numbers or object representation, which can be very useful for debugging complex data structures.

### Examples:

1. **String and Integer**:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello %s, you have %d unread messages.", "Alice", 5);
   ```
   Output: `Hello Alice, you have 5 unread messages.`

2. **Floating Point Number**:
   ```javascript
   console.log("The price is $%f", 19.99);
   ```
   Output: `The price is $19.990000`

3. **Objects**:
   ```javascript
   const obj = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };
   console.log("User details: %o", obj);
   ```
   Output: `User details: { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }`

4. **Styled Console Output**:
   ```javascript
   console.log("%cThis text is styled!", "color: red; font-size: 16px;");
   ```
   This applies CSS styles to the console output.

Using these specifiers helps in creating more structured and maintainable logging, especially in large applications.
