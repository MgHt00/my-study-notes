Yes, exactly! Even if you are not working with a recursive generator, you can use `yield*` in place of `yield` to delegate the yielding process to another iterable. 

### Key Differences:
- **`yield`**: It yields a single value at a time.
- **`yield*`**: It iterates over another iterable and yields each of its values one by one.

### Use Cases:
- **`yield`**: Use it when you want to yield individual values directly.
- **`yield*`**: Use it when you have an iterable (like an array or string) and you want to yield all of its values without manually iterating over them.

### Example with `yield*` (non-recursive):
```javascript
function* example() {
    yield 1;
    yield* [2, 3, 4]; // Delegates yielding to the array
    yield 5;
}

console.log([...example()]); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Example with `yield`:
```javascript
function* example() {
    yield 1;
    for (let value of [2, 3, 4]) {
        yield value; // Manually yield each value
    }
    yield 5;
}

console.log([...example()]); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Both examples produce the same result, but `yield*` simplifies the process when dealing with iterables.
