Let's give it another shot! I'll simulate the first 5 iterations step-by-step without crashing this time. Here's the plan:

1. I'll initialize `x` and `y`.
2. I'll go through the loop, showing what happens at each step.

Let's go!

### Initial Setup:
- `x = 0`
- `y = 1`

### Iteration 1:
- `yield y;` (yields `1`)
- Update: `[x, y] = [y, x + y]` -> `[x, y] = [1, 0 + 1]` -> `x = 1`, `y = 1`

### Iteration 2:
- `yield y;` (yields `1`)
- Update: `[x, y] = [y, x + y]` -> `[x, y] = [1, 1 + 1]` -> `x = 1`, `y = 2`

### Iteration 3:
- `yield y;` (yields `2`)
- Update: `[x, y] = [y, x + y]` -> `[x, y] = [2, 1 + 2]` -> `x = 2`, `y = 3`

### Iteration 4:
- `yield y;` (yields `3`)
- Update: `[x, y] = [y, x + y]` -> `[x, y] = [3, 2 + 3]` -> `x = 3`, `y = 5`

### Iteration 5:
- `yield y;` (yields `5`)
- Update: `[x, y] = [y, x + y]` -> `[x, y] = [5, 3 + 5]` -> `x = 5`, `y = 8`

After 5 iterations, the yielded values are `1, 1, 2, 3, 5`. 

The fifth call to `fibonacciSequence` yields `5`, which matches what `fibonacci(5)` should return after decrementing `n` each time and checking when `n` reaches `0`.

How was that? ðŸ˜Š
