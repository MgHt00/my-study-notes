You're asking an excellent question, and it's rooted in understanding how Promises and their methods work! Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **What the Authors Mean by "Promises cannot represent repeated asynchronous computations"**

This statement means that a **single Promise** represents the result (either fulfilled or rejected) of a **single asynchronous computation**. A Promise is **not reusable** for new computations once it is resolved or rejected. 

In other words:
- A Promise is like a one-time ticket. Once it completes, it cannot "start over" or "restart."
- If you need to represent **repeated computations**, you'll need to create a **new Promise** for each computation.

---

### 2. **What Happens When You Call `then()` Multiple Times on the Same Promise?**

This is a different concept. The `then()` method is an **instance method of the Promise object**, and calling it multiple times on the same Promise doesn't change the Promise itself. It just registers **multiple callbacks** (like registering multiple event handlers with `addEventListener()`).

- All the callbacks registered with `then()` will execute **when the Promise resolves or rejects**.
- This doesn't mean the Promise "restarts" or computes againâ€”it means multiple callbacks get executed with the same resolved or rejected value.

Example:
```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), 1000); // Simulates an async computation
});

// Registering multiple callbacks
promise.then((result) => console.log(`Callback 1: ${result}`)); // Output: Callback 1: Done!
promise.then((result) => console.log(`Callback 2: ${result}`)); // Output: Callback 2: Done!
promise.then((result) => console.log(`Callback 3: ${result}`)); // Output: Callback 3: Done!
```

In this case:
- The Promise resolves with the value `"Done!"` **once**.
- All three callbacks (`Callback 1`, `Callback 2`, `Callback 3`) are executed in the order they were registered, but they use the same resolved value.

---

### 3. **So, Are You Calling the Instance Method Multiple Times?**
Yes, exactly! When you call `then()` on a Promise, you're calling an **instance method** of that Promise. Each `then()` call registers a new callback.

This doesn't affect the Promise itselfâ€”it just adds more listeners that respond when the Promise resolves or rejects.

---

### 4. **Promises and Repeated Computations**

If you need repeated asynchronous computations, you can't reuse a Promise. Instead, you create new Promises. For example:

```javascript
function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

// Using the same function to create multiple Promises
delay(1000).then(() => console.log("1 second passed"));
delay(2000).then(() => console.log("2 seconds passed"));
delay(3000).then(() => console.log("3 seconds passed"));
```

Here, each call to `delay()` creates a **new Promise**.

---

### 5. **Summary**

1. Promises represent **one-time** asynchronous computations.
2. You can call the `then()` method (an instance method of the Promise) multiple times, and each callback you register will run when the Promise resolves or rejects.
3. If you need to handle **repeated asynchronous computations**, you create new Promises.

---

The authors continue, "It is worth nothing that the function you pass to then() is invoked asynchronously, even if the asynchronous computation is already complete when you call then()."

---

You're welcomeâ€”I'm glad it's starting to make sense! ðŸ˜Š The authors are pointing out an **important feature of Promises** here: the function passed to `then()` is always invoked **asynchronously**, even if the Promise has already been resolved or rejected. Let me explain what this means step by step:

---

### 1. **Promises Always Use the Microtask Queue**
When you call `then()` on a Promise, the callback function you provide will always be scheduled to run **asynchronously**. This means:
- The callback won't run immediately, even if the Promise is already resolved.
- Instead, it will be placed in the **microtask queue** and will run **after the current synchronous code finishes executing**.

---

### 2. **What Happens if the Promise Is Already Resolved?**
If the Promise is already resolved when you call `then()`, the callback still wonâ€™t execute immediately. JavaScript will schedule it to run **after the current code finishes**.

---

### 3. **Why Does This Happen?**
This behavior is intentional and part of the **Promise specification**. It ensures that callbacks added with `then()` are always executed consistently and predictably, whether:
- The Promise resolves before or after `then()` is called.
- The Promise resolves synchronously or asynchronously.

---

### 4. **Example to Demonstrate This**
Hereâ€™s a simple example to show that `then()` callbacks are always invoked asynchronously:

```javascript
const promise = Promise.resolve("Resolved value");

// Add a callback to the Promise
promise.then((value) => console.log("Promise callback:", value));

console.log("This logs before the promise callback");
```

**Output:**
```
This logs before the promise callback
Promise callback: Resolved value
```

---

### 5. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. **`Promise.resolve("Resolved value")`**: This creates an already-resolved Promise.
2. **`promise.then(...)`**: The callback is registered, but it is scheduled to run asynchronously (in the microtask queue).
3. **`console.log("This logs before the promise callback")`**: This runs immediately because it's synchronous.
4. **Microtask queue is processed**: The callback from `then()` runs, printing `"Promise callback: Resolved value"`.

---

### 6. **Another Example with Delayed Resolution**
To contrast, hereâ€™s an example where the Promise resolves asynchronously:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved later"), 1000); // Asynchronous resolution
});

promise.then((value) => console.log("Promise callback:", value));

console.log("This logs immediately");
```

**Output:**
```
This logs immediately
Promise callback: Resolved later
```

---

### 7. **Why Is This Behavior Important?**
This consistency avoids confusion. For example:
- Whether the Promise resolves immediately or later, you donâ€™t need to worry about timing issuesâ€”your callback will always run **after** the current code finishes.
- This ensures that code behaves predictably in all cases.

---

### 8. **How Is This Related to the Event Loop?**
The Promise callback runs in the **microtask queue**, which has a higher priority than the **task queue** (where `setTimeout` callbacks go). This means Promise callbacks will execute before `setTimeout` or other task queue functions.
