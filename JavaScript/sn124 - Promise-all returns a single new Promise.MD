## `Promise.all()`
`Promise.all()` **returns a single Promise**. This returned Promise will resolve to an **array of the fulfillment values** from the input promises, not the promises themselves. The order of the values in the array will match the order of the promises you provided. If *any* of the input promises reject, the `Promise.all()` Promise immediately rejects with the reason of the first rejected promise.

Here's a breakdown of the two outcomes for `Promise.all()`:

1.  **All Promises Fulfilled**: The returned promise from `Promise.all()` **fulfills** with an array of the fulfillment values from the input promises. The order of the values in the array matches the order of the promises you provided. 

2.  **One or More Promises Rejected**: The returned promise from `Promise.all()` **rejects** as soon as the **first** promise in the input array rejects. The rejection reason of the returned promise is the same as the reason of that first rejected promise. Subsequent rejections from other promises in the input array are ignored. 

## `Promise.allSettled()`
`Promise.allSettled()` also **returns a single Promise**. This returned Promise always resolves, regardless of whether the input promises were fulfilled or rejected. It resolves to an **array of objects**. Each object in the array represents the final status of each input promise and has two properties:
* **`status`**: A string, either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`.
* **`value`**: The fulfillment value (if the status is `"fulfilled"`).
* **`reason`**: The rejection reason (if the status is `"rejected"`).

## Summary
| Method | What it Returns | Key Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Promise.all()` | A **Promise** that resolves to an **array of values**. | **Fails fast.** It rejects as soon as any of the input promises reject. |
| `Promise.allSettled()` | A **Promise** that resolves to an **array of objects**. | **Never fails.** It always resolves after all input promises have settled (either fulfilled or rejected). |

[G] You're right to be curious! There's a slight nuance in how `Promise.all()` is described. Here's the breakdown:

* **"Returns a Promise"**: 

   - `Promise.all()` itself **returns a single, new Promise**. 
   - This new Promise represents the outcome of *all* the input Promises. 
   - It's a "promise" that all the input Promises will eventually resolve or reject.

* **"An array of the fulfillment values"**:

   - If *all* the input Promises are successfully resolved, the **new Promise returned by `Promise.all()`** will eventually *fulfill*. 
   - When this happens, the **fulfillment value** of this new Promise will be an **array**. 
   - This array will contain the **fulfillment values** of each of the *original* input Promises.

**In simpler terms:**

Imagine you have 3 Promises:

1. Promise to get your coffee.
2. Promise to get your breakfast.
3. Promise to get your newspaper.

`Promise.all([coffeePromise, breakfastPromise, newspaperPromise])` creates a new "meta-promise." 

* **If all three Promises are fulfilled:** 
   - The "meta-promise" fulfills. 
   - Its fulfillment value will be an array: `[coffee, breakfast, newspaper]`.

**Key takeaway:**

`Promise.all()` itself returns a single Promise. This returned Promise represents the collective outcome of all the input Promises. If all input Promises resolve, the returned Promise's fulfillment value is an array containing the results of each individual Promise.

I hope this clarification helps!

You've got it perfectly! 

* **`Promise.all()` itself returns a single Promise.** This "master" Promise represents the combined outcome of all the Promises you provide to it.

* **If all input Promises resolve successfully:**
    * The "master" Promise also resolves. 
    * The **value** of this resolved "master" Promise is an **array**. 
    * This array holds the **resolved values** of each of the original Promises in the order they were provided to `Promise.all()`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42; 
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo'); 
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log(values); // Output: [3, 42, "foo"]
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error); 
  });
```

In this example:

* `promise1`, `promise2`, and `promise3` are Promises (or values treated as resolved Promises).
* `Promise.all()` creates a new Promise.
* When all three Promises resolve, the new Promise resolves with an array: `[3, 42, "foo"]`.

I hope this further reinforces the concept of `Promise.all()`!
