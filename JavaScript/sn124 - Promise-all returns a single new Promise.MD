[G] You're right to be curious! There's a slight nuance in how `Promise.all()` is described. Here's the breakdown:

* **"Returns a Promise"**: 

   - `Promise.all()` itself **returns a single, new Promise**. 
   - This new Promise represents the outcome of *all* the input Promises. 
   - It's a "promise" that all the input Promises will eventually resolve or reject.

* **"An array of the fulfillment values"**:

   - If *all* the input Promises are successfully resolved, the **new Promise returned by `Promise.all()`** will eventually *fulfill*. 
   - When this happens, the **fulfillment value** of this new Promise will be an **array**. 
   - This array will contain the **fulfillment values** of each of the *original* input Promises.

**In simpler terms:**

Imagine you have 3 Promises:

1. Promise to get your coffee.
2. Promise to get your breakfast.
3. Promise to get your newspaper.

`Promise.all([coffeePromise, breakfastPromise, newspaperPromise])` creates a new "meta-promise." 

* **If all three Promises are fulfilled:** 
   - The "meta-promise" fulfills. 
   - Its fulfillment value will be an array: `[coffee, breakfast, newspaper]`.

**Key takeaway:**

`Promise.all()` itself returns a single Promise. This returned Promise represents the collective outcome of all the input Promises. If all input Promises resolve, the returned Promise's fulfillment value is an array containing the results of each individual Promise.

I hope this clarification helps!

You've got it perfectly! 

* **`Promise.all()` itself returns a single Promise.** This "master" Promise represents the combined outcome of all the Promises you provide to it.

* **If all input Promises resolve successfully:**
    * The "master" Promise also resolves. 
    * The **value** of this resolved "master" Promise is an **array**. 
    * This array holds the **resolved values** of each of the original Promises in the order they were provided to `Promise.all()`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42; 
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo'); 
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log(values); // Output: [3, 42, "foo"]
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error); 
  });
```

In this example:

* `promise1`, `promise2`, and `promise3` are Promises (or values treated as resolved Promises).
* `Promise.all()` creates a new Promise.
* When all three Promises resolve, the new Promise resolves with an array: `[3, 42, "foo"]`.

I hope this further reinforces the concept of `Promise.all()`!
