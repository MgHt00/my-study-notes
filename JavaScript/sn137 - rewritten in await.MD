[G] The provided code has a few issues:

1. **Missing `async` keyword:** To use `await`, the code must be within an `async` function.

2. **`doSomething` function definition:** The `doSomething` function definition should be outside the `async` context.

Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
async function processData() { 
  const bodies = await fetchSequentially(urls); 
  doSomething(bodies); 
}

function doSomething(bodies) { 
  // ... do something with the bodies ... 
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`async function processData()`:** This defines an asynchronous function that will use `await`.
- **`const bodies = await fetchSequentially(urls);`:** This line waits for the `fetchSequentially(urls)` function (which presumably returns a Promise) to resolve. The resolved value (the `bodies` array) is then assigned to the `bodies` variable.
- **`doSomething(bodies);`:** This calls the `doSomething` function, passing the `bodies` array to it.

This corrected version effectively uses `await` to wait for the result of `fetchSequentially(urls)` before proceeding with the `doSomething` function.

**Note:**

* The `fetchSequentially(urls)` function itself would also likely need to be an `async` function to use `await` internally (if it's fetching data from multiple URLs sequentially).

I hope this clarified the correct usage of `await` in this context!

You're right, we need to include error handling. Here's how you can rewrite the code using `await` and a `try...catch` block:

```javascript
async function processData() {
  try {
    const bodies = await fetchSequentially(urls); 
    doSomething(bodies); 
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error); 
  }
}

function doSomething(bodies) { 
  // ... do something with the bodies ... 
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `try` block encompasses the code that might throw an error, specifically the `await fetchSequentially(urls);` part. 
- If `fetchSequentially(urls)` throws an error (e.g., network issues, errors during data fetching), the code execution jumps to the `catch` block.
- The `catch` block handles the error by logging it to the console.

This approach provides a cleaner and more structured way to handle potential errors when using `await` with asynchronous functions.

I hope this revised version is clearer and more helpful!
