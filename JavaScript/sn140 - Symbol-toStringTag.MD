[G] You've hit upon a great point about `Symbol.toStringTag`! Let's clarify its purpose and how it works.

**1. `Symbol.toStringTag` and `Object.prototype.toString()`**

* **`Object.prototype.toString()`:** This is a built-in method in JavaScript that returns a string representation of an object.  By default, it returns a string like `"[object Object]"`.

* **`Symbol.toStringTag`:** This special symbol allows you to customize the string that `Object.prototype.toString()` returns.

   - When `Object.prototype.toString()` is called on an object, it *first* checks if the object has a property with the key `Symbol.toStringTag`.
   - If the property exists, its *value* is used in the string representation.
   - If the property *doesn't* exist, the default `"[object Object]"` is used.

**2. "on its argument"**

The phrase "on its argument" simply means that `Object.prototype.toString()` looks for the `Symbol.toStringTag` property **on the object that it's called upon**.  In your example, `Object.prototype.toString()` is implicitly called when you pass `r` to `classof()` (which internally uses `Object.prototype.toString()`). Therefore, `Object.prototype.toString()` looks for the `Symbol.toStringTag` property *on the `r` object*.

**3. Why a Symbol, Not an Ordinary Property?**

* **Uniqueness:** Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. This prevents accidental name collisions with other properties that your class might have. You wouldn't want a regular string property named `toStringTag` to interfere with the intended behavior of `Symbol.toStringTag`.

* **Controlled Customization:** Symbols provide a controlled way for built-in methods (like `Object.prototype.toString()`) to access special properties without interfering with other properties.

**4. Why a Getter Property?**

While you *can* define `Symbol.toStringTag` as a regular property, using a getter property (defined with `get`) offers more flexibility:

* **Dynamic Value:** A getter allows you to compute the value of the tag dynamically based on the object's state.  For example, you could have:

   ```javascript
   class Range {
       constructor(min, max) {
           this.min = min;
           this.max = max;
       }
       get [Symbol.toStringTag]() {
           return `Range (${this.min}, ${this.max})`; // Dynamic tag
       }
   }
   ```

* **Read-Only:** A getter can also be used to create a read-only property, preventing accidental modification of the tag from outside the class.

**In summary:**

* `Symbol.toStringTag` allows you to customize the string representation of your objects.
* Using a Symbol ensures that the tag property doesn't conflict with other properties.
* A getter property provides flexibility for dynamic tag values and read-only access.

I hope this clarifies the purpose and usage of `Symbol.toStringTag`!
