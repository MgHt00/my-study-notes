[G] You've highlighted a very insightful passage that explains the motivation behind the introduction of `Set` and `Map` in ES6. Let's break it down:

**Objects as Makeshift Sets and Maps (Before ES6)**

JavaScript objects, even before ES6, *could* be used to simulate sets and maps.

* **Objects as Sets:** You could use the *keys* of an object to represent the elements of a set. If a key existed in the object, it meant the element was in the set.  The *values* associated with the keys were often just `true` as a simple marker of presence.

   ```javascript
   const mySet = {};

   mySet.a = true; // Add "a" to the set
   mySet.b = true; // Add "b" to the set

   if (mySet.a) { // Check if "a" is in the set
       console.log("a is in the set");
   }
   ```

* **Objects as Maps:** You could use the *keys* of an object to represent the keys of a map, and the *values* of the object properties to represent the values of the map.

   ```javascript
   const myMap = {};

   myMap.name = "Alice";
   myMap.age = 30;

   console.log(myMap.name); // Output: Alice
   ```

**Limitations of Using Objects as Sets and Maps**

1. **Key Type Restriction:** Object keys are always strings (or Symbols, but let's focus on strings for now). This limits you to using only strings as elements in your "sets" or keys in your "maps." You couldn't directly use numbers, objects, or other data types as keys.

2. **Inherited Properties:** Objects inherit properties from their prototype chain. This means they might have properties like `toString`, `valueOf`, etc., that are not part of the set or map you're trying to create.  These inherited properties can clutter your "set" or "map" and make it harder to work with your data.

3. **No Dedicated Methods:** Objects lack dedicated methods for set and map operations (like adding, deleting, checking for existence, iterating). You had to manually implement these operations, which was often cumbersome.

**Why ES6 Introduced `Set` and `Map`**

ES6 introduced `Set` and `Map` to address these limitations:

* **`Set`:** A true set data structure that can store *any* data type as an element (not just strings) and provides dedicated methods for set operations.
* **`Map`:** A true map data structure that can map *any* data type to any other data type and provides dedicated methods for map operations.

**In essence:**

The author is explaining that while objects *could* be used as makeshift sets and maps before ES6, they had limitations.  `Set` and `Map` were introduced to provide dedicated, more robust, and more flexible data structures for representing sets and maps in JavaScript. They offer key type flexibility, avoid the problem of inherited properties, and provide convenient methods for common set and map operations.
