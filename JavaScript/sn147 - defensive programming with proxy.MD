[G] Yes, absolutely. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use a revocable proxy to protect a function when passing it to an external library (or a function simulating an external library):

**Scenario:**

Imagine you have a function that holds sensitive data or performs critical operations. You want to pass this function to an external library, but you want to ensure the library can't call it after you're done.

**Example Code:**

```javascript
// Simulate an external library
function externalLibrary(callback) {
  // The library might call the callback later, potentially at unexpected times
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      callback(); // Try to call the callback
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Library tried to call revoked function:", error.message);
    }
  }, 2000);
}

// Our sensitive function
function sensitiveFunction() {
  console.log("Sensitive function called!");
  // Perform critical operations here...
}

// Create a revocable proxy
const { proxy, revoke } = Proxy.revocable(sensitiveFunction, {});

// Pass the proxy to the library
externalLibrary(proxy);

// Revoke the proxy after a certain time (e.g., when you're done)
setTimeout(() => {
  revoke();
  console.log("Proxy revoked!");
}, 1000);

// The library tries to call the function after the proxy is revoked
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`externalLibrary(callback)`:**
    * This function simulates an external library that receives a callback.
    * It uses `setTimeout()` to simulate a delay before calling the callback, representing a scenario where the library might call the function at an unexpected time.

2.  **`sensitiveFunction()`:**
    * This is the function we want to protect.
    * It represents a function with sensitive data or critical operations.

3.  **`Proxy.revocable(sensitiveFunction, {})`:**
    * This creates a revocable proxy around `sensitiveFunction`.
    * The `{}` is an empty handler object, meaning we're not intercepting any operations other than the function call itself.
    * `Proxy.revocable()` returns an object with `proxy` and `revoke` properties.
        * `proxy`: The proxy object that we pass to the library.
        * `revoke`: A function that revokes the proxy.

4.  **`externalLibrary(proxy)`:**
    * We pass the `proxy` object to the external library.

5.  **`setTimeout(() => { revoke(); ... }, 1000)`:**
    * After 1 second, we call the `revoke()` function to revoke the proxy.
    * This prevents the library from calling the original `sensitiveFunction()` through the proxy.

6.  **Library's Attempt to Call the Function:**
    * After 2 seconds, the library's `setTimeout()` callback tries to call the proxy.
    * Since the proxy has been revoked, calling it throws a `TypeError`.
    * The `try...catch` block in the library catches the error and logs a message.

**Output:**

```
Proxy revoked!
Library tried to call revoked function: Cannot perform 'apply' on a proxy that has been revoked
```

**Key Takeaway:**

Using a revocable proxy allows you to control the lifetime of a function that you pass to an external library. You can revoke the proxy when you're done, preventing the library from calling the function at unexpected times and enhancing the security and predictability of your code.
