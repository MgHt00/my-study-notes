[G] You've zeroed in on a very important detail about how proxy handlers work! Let's clarify how the `get` trap in a proxy handler receives its arguments:

**Understanding the `get` Trap**

When you access a property on a proxy object (like `identity.x`), the `get` trap in the proxy's handler is invoked.

**The `get` Trap's Parameters**

The `get` trap receives three parameters:

1.  **`target` (or `o` in the Author's example):** This is the *target object* that the proxy is wrapping. In the example, it's the empty object `{}`.

2.  **`property` (or `name` in the Author's example):** This is the *name of the property* that was accessed. In the example, it's the string `"x"`.

3.  **`receiver` (or `target` in the Author's example):** This is the *proxy object itself*. It's the object on which the property access was performed.

**How `identity.x` Works**

1.  **Property Access:** When you write `identity.x`, you're trying to access the property `x` on the `identity` proxy object.

2.  **`get` Trap Invocation:** This triggers the `get` trap in the proxy's handler.

3.  **Parameter Values:** The `get` trap is called with the following arguments:
    * `target` (or `o`): `{}` (the empty object)
    * `property` (or `name`): `"x"`
    * `receiver` (or `target`): `identity` (the proxy object)

4.  **Getter Execution:** The `get` trap's code is executed: `return name;`.

5.  **Return Value:** The `get` trap returns the value of `name`, which is `"x"`.

6.  **Result:** The expression `identity.x` evaluates to `"x"`.

**Why It Seems Like There Are Missing Parameters**

You are correct that the getter is expecting 3 parameters. But the javascript engine automatically fills those parameters when the getter is called by the proxy. You are not manually calling the getter. The javascript engine is.

**In essence:**

The JavaScript engine handles the passing of these parameters when the `get` trap is triggered by property access on the proxy object. You don't have to manually provide the arguments when you access the property. The proxy system takes care of it for you.
