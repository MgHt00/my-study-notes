[G] No, ordinary `<script>` tags are **not** deferred by default. This is a very common point of confusion, so it's good to clarify.

Here's the breakdown of how ordinary `<script>` tags behave:

**Ordinary `<script>` Tags (Without `async` or `defer`)**

* **Blocking Behavior:**
    * When the browser encounters an ordinary `<script>` tag, it immediately stops parsing the HTML document.
    * It then downloads and executes the script.
    * Only after the script has finished executing does the browser resume parsing the rest of the HTML.
* **Synchronous Execution:**
    * Scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML document.
    * This means that if a script takes a long time to download or execute, it will block the rendering of the page.
* **No Deferred Execution:**
    * Ordinary `<script>` tags do not wait for the DOM to be parsed before executing.

**Why This Matters**

* **Page Load Performance:** Blocking behavior can significantly impact page load performance, as the browser cannot render the rest of the page until the script has finished.
* **DOM Manipulation:** If a script tries to manipulate the DOM before it's fully loaded, it might encounter errors or unexpected behavior.

**How to Change the Behavior**

* **`async`:** To download the script asynchronously without blocking parsing and execute it as soon as it's available.
* **`defer`:** To download the script asynchronously without blocking parsing and execute it after the DOM is fully parsed, in the order they appear.
* **`<script type="module">`:** To treat the script as a module, which has deferred execution by default.

**In summary:**

* Ordinary `<script>` tags block HTML parsing and execute immediately.
* They are not deferred by default.
* Use `async` or `defer` to change the loading behavior and improve performance.

You're right to focus on that detail! It highlights a specific aspect of how non-module scripts without `async` or `defer` interact with the DOM during parsing. Let's break it down:

**Understanding the Behavior**

1.  **Synchronous Parsing and Execution:**
    * As we discussed, non-module `<script>` tags without `async` or `defer` are parsed and executed synchronously.
    * This means the browser stops parsing the HTML document when it encounters such a script tag.

2.  **Partial DOM Availability:**
    * At the point where the script starts executing, the browser has already built a partial DOM tree containing:
        * The `<script>` tag itself.
        * All HTML content that comes *before* the `<script>` tag in the document.

3.  **Accessing Previous Content:**
    * Therefore, the script can access and manipulate the elements that are already present in the partial DOM.
    * It can use methods like `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, etc., to find and work with those elements.

4.  **Content After the Script:**
    * However, the script *cannot* access or rely on elements that come *after* the `<script>` tag in the document.
    * These elements haven't been parsed yet, so they don't exist in the DOM when the script runs.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Script Access Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="before">This paragraph is before the script.</p>

  <script>
    const beforeParagraph = document.getElementById("before");
    console.log(beforeParagraph); // Output: <p id="before">...</p>

    const afterParagraph = document.getElementById("after");
    console.log(afterParagraph); // Output: null (because it doesn't exist yet)
  </script>

  <p id="after">This paragraph is after the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* The script can successfully access the paragraph with the ID "before" because it has already been parsed.
* The script cannot access the paragraph with the ID "after" because it hasn't been parsed yet.

**Why This Matters**

* **Script Placement:** The placement of `<script>` tags in the HTML document matters.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Scripts can only safely manipulate elements that are present in the DOM when they execute.
* **Potential Errors:** If a script tries to access elements that haven't been parsed yet, it will result in errors or unexpected behavior.

**In essence:**

Non-module scripts without `async` or `defer` execute synchronously, allowing them to access the portion of the DOM that has been parsed up to their own `<script>` tag. They cannot access content that comes after their tag in the document.
