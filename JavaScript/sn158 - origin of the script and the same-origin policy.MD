[G] You've highlighted a very important and often misunderstood aspect of the same-origin policy! Let's break it down:

**The Key Concept: Document Origin, Not Script Origin**

The same-origin policy is concerned with the *origin of the document* that contains the script, not the origin of the script file itself.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Document Origin:**
    * The origin of a document is determined by its protocol (e.g., `http`, `https`), domain (e.g., `example.com`), and port (e.g., `80`, `443`).
    * When a browser loads an HTML document, it establishes the origin of that document.

2.  **Script Origin:**
    * The origin of a script file is also determined by its protocol, domain, and port.
    * However, the origin of the script file is *not* what the same-origin policy checks when determining if a script can access another resource.

3.  **Policy Focus:**
    * The same-origin policy focuses on whether the *document* that is running the script is allowed to access a resource, regardless of where the script file came from.

**Example:**

Let's say we have:

* **`http://example.com/page.html`:** This is our main HTML document.
* **`http://cdn.example-cdn.com/script.js`:** This is a script file hosted on a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
* **`http://api.different-domain.com/data.json`:** This is a JSON API on a different domain.

**Scenario:**

1.  **`page.html` loads `script.js`:**
    * `page.html` includes `script.js` using a `<script>` tag.
    * The browser downloads `script.js` from `cdn.example-cdn.com`.

2.  **`script.js` tries to fetch `data.json`:**
    * `script.js` contains JavaScript code that uses `fetch` to request `data.json` from `api.different-domain.com`.

**Outcome:**

* **The same-origin policy check is based on the origin of `page.html` (`http://example.com`), not the origin of `script.js` (`http://cdn.example-cdn.com`).**
* If `api.different-domain.com` does not allow cross-origin requests from `http://example.com` (using CORS), the `fetch` request will be blocked, even though `script.js` came from a different domain.

**Why This Matters:**

* **CDNs:** It allows you to use scripts from CDNs without worrying about the same-origin policy blocking your scripts from running in your document.
* **Security:** It maintains the security of the same-origin policy by focusing on the document's origin, which is the context in which the script is running.

**In essence:**

The browser cares about where the document that contains the script came from, not where the script file itself came from. This ensures that the security of the same-origin policy is maintained.
