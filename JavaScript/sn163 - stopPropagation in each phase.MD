[G] Yes, let's break down how `stopPropagation()` works in each phase of event propagation.

**Understanding the Phases:**

1.  **Capturing Phase:** Event travels down the DOM tree (window -> target).
2.  **Target Phase:** Event reaches the target element.
3.  **Bubbling Phase:** Event travels up the DOM tree (target -> window).

**`stopPropagation()` in Each Phase:**

1.  **Capturing Phase:**

    * **Scenario:** You have a capturing event listener on an ancestor element, and you call `stopPropagation()` within that listener.
    * **Effect:**
        * The event will stop propagating down the DOM tree.
        * Subsequent capturing listeners on descendant elements will not be invoked.
        * The target phase and bubbling phase will not occur.
    * **Use Case:** Preventing the event from reaching specific elements or skipping entire branches of the DOM tree.

2.  **Target Phase:**

    * **Scenario:** You call `stopPropagation()` within the event listener on the target element itself.
    * **Effect:**
        * The bubbling phase will not occur.
        * However, other event listeners on the same target element will still be invoked (unless you use `stopImmediatePropagation()`).
    * **Use Case:** Preventing the event from bubbling up to ancestor elements.

3.  **Bubbling Phase:**

    * **Scenario:** You call `stopPropagation()` within a bubbling event listener on an ancestor element.
    * **Effect:**
        * The event will stop propagating further up the DOM tree.
        * Subsequent bubbling listeners on ancestor elements will not be invoked.
    * **Use Case:** Preventing the event from reaching higher-level elements or global event handlers.

**Example Illustrating All Phases:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>stopPropagation() in All Phases</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="outer">
    <div id="inner">
      <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script>
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    const inner = document.getElementById("inner");
    const outer = document.getElementById("outer");

    // Capturing phase
    outer.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
      console.log("Outer capturing");
      //event.stopPropagation(); // Uncomment to stop in capturing
    }, true);

    // Target phase
    button.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
      console.log("Button target");
      event.stopPropagation(); // Stop propagation at the target
    });

    // Bubbling phase
    inner.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
      console.log("Inner bubbling");
      //event.stopPropagation(); // Uncomment to stop in bubbling
    });

    outer.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        console.log("outer bubbling");
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* `stopPropagation()` provides fine-grained control over event propagation.
* You can use it to stop the event at any point in the capturing, target, or bubbling phases.
* Understanding how it works in each phase is essential for building complex event handling logic.
* The place you call stopPropagation() determines what events will still fire.
