[G] You've picked up on a key aspect of how the DOM (Document Object Model) is structured! Let's break down what that statement means.

**Understanding Nodes in the DOM:**

* The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree-like structure of nodes.
* There are different types of nodes, including:
    * **Element nodes:** Represent HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`).
    * **Text nodes:** Represent the text content within elements.
    * **Attribute nodes:** Represent attributes of elements (e.g., `id`, `class`).
    * And others...

**The `Node` Class:**

* In the DOM hierarchy, the `Node` class is the base class for all node types.
* This means that all node types inherit properties and methods from the `Node` class.

**`textContent` Property:**

* The `textContent` property is defined on the `Node` class.
* Therefore, it is available on all node types, including element nodes and text nodes.

**What It Means:**

1.  **Element Nodes:**
    * When you use `textContent` on an element node, it returns the combined text content of the element and all its descendant nodes.
    * It essentially strips away all HTML tags and returns only the plain text.

2.  **Text Nodes:**
    * When you use `textContent` on a text node, it returns the text content of that node.
    * This is the direct text that is contained within the text node.

**Illustrative Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>textContent Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="myDiv">
    <p>This is some <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
    And some more text.
  </div>

  <script>
    const myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv");
    const paragraph = myDiv.querySelector("p");
    const textNode = paragraph.firstChild; // The text node "This is some "

    // Element node
    console.log("myDiv.textContent:", myDiv.textContent); // "This is some bold text. And some more text."

    // text node
    console.log("textNode.textContent:", textNode.textContent); // "This is some "
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* `myDiv.textContent` returns all the text content within the `<div>`, including the text from the `<p>` element, but without the `<strong>` tag.
* `textNode.textContent` returns only the text content of the first text node within the `<p>` element.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Consistency:** It provides a consistent way to access text content across different node types.
* **Simplicity:** It simplifies the process of extracting plain text from the DOM.
* **Security:** When you use `textContent` to insert text into the DOM, it automatically escapes HTML entities, preventing potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting attacks).

**In Summary:**

Because textContent is a property of the Node class, it can be used on all nodes, text and element nodes. It simplifies extracting text from the DOM.
