[G] Yes, let's illustrate a scenario where you might need to return a Promise from a function even if the underlying operation is synchronous. This often happens when you're creating a consistent API that's expected to be Promise-based, or when you anticipate that the implementation might become asynchronous in the future.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're building a utility function that checks if a given number is even. For now, the check is purely synchronous. However, you decide that in a future version, you might want to fetch this information from a configuration file or a remote service, which would involve asynchronous operations. To maintain a consistent API, you choose to return a Promise from the beginning.

**Illustrative Example:**

```javascript
function isNumberEven(number) {
  // The even check is currently synchronous
  const isEven = number % 2 === 0;

  // Return a Promise that resolves with the result
  return Promise.resolve(isEven);
}

// Using the function
isNumberEven(4)
  .then(result => {
    console.log(`Is 4 even? ${result}`); // Output: Is 4 even? true
  });

isNumberEven(7)
  .then(result => {
    console.log(`Is 7 even? ${result}`); // Output: Is 7 even? false
  });

async function checkNumber() {
  const result1 = await isNumberEven(10);
  console.log(`Is 10 even? ${result1}`); // Output: Is 10 even? true

  const result2 = await isNumberEven(15);
  console.log(`Is 15 even? ${result2}`); // Output: Is 15 even? false
}

checkNumber();
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Synchronous Logic:** Inside the `isNumberEven` function, the check `number % 2 === 0` is performed synchronously. The result (`true` or `false`) is immediately available.

2.  **`Promise.resolve()`:** Instead of directly returning the boolean value, we use `Promise.resolve(isEven)`.
    * `Promise.resolve(value)` creates a Promise that is already resolved with the given `value`. This effectively wraps our synchronous result in a Promise.

3.  **Consistent Promise-Based API:** By returning a Promise, the `isNumberEven` function now adheres to a Promise-based API. Consumers of this function can always use `.then()` to handle the result, regardless of whether the underlying operation was synchronous or asynchronous.

4.  **Future-Proofing:** If we later decide to make the even check asynchronous (e.g., by reading from a file), we can modify the `isNumberEven` function to perform an actual asynchronous operation and resolve the Promise with the result. The calling code (using `.then()` or `await`) won't need to change because it's already expecting a Promise.

**Another Example: Caching**

Consider a simple caching mechanism. The first time you request data, you might fetch it asynchronously. Subsequent requests might find the data in the cache, which is a synchronous lookup. To provide a consistent Promise-based API:

```javascript
const cache = {};

function getData(key) {
  if (cache[key]) {
    console.log(`Serving ${key} from cache (synchronous)`);
    return Promise.resolve(cache[key]); // Return cached data as a resolved Promise
  } else {
    console.log(`Fetching ${key} (simulated asynchronous)`);
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const data = `Data for ${key}`;
        cache[key] = data;
        resolve(data);
      }, 500);
    });
  }
}

getData("item1").then(data => console.log("Result:", data));
getData("item1").then(data => console.log("Result (cached):", data));
getData("item2").then(data => console.log("Result:", data));
```

In this caching example, `getData` returns a Promise in both the synchronous (cache hit) and asynchronous (cache miss) scenarios, providing a consistent interface for the caller.

**In Summary:**

Returning a `Promise.resolve()` for synchronous operations when building a Promise-based API offers consistency, improves predictability for consumers of your code, and makes it easier to transition to asynchronous implementations in the future without breaking existing code.
