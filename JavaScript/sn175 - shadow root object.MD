[G] Let's break down what the Author means by that statement about the `attachShadow()` method.

**1. The Host Element:**

When you want to attach a Shadow DOM tree to a regular DOM element (like a `<div>`, a custom element, etc.), that regular DOM element is called the **host element**. It's the element that will have a Shadow DOM attached to it.

**2. The `attachShadow()` Method:**

The `attachShadow()` method is a method of the **host element**. You call it on the host element to create and attach a Shadow DOM tree to it.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const shadowRoot = hostElement.attachShadow(shadowRootInit);
```

* `hostElement`: The DOM element you want to attach the Shadow DOM to.
* `shadowRootInit`: An object that can have the following properties:
    * `mode`: A string that specifies the encapsulation mode of the shadow DOM. It can be:
        * `'open'`: The shadow root's internal DOM can be accessed from JavaScript outside the shadow root using the host element's `shadowRoot` property.
        * `'closed'`: The shadow root's internal DOM cannot be accessed from JavaScript outside the shadow root (the `shadowRoot` property of the host element will return `null`).
* `shadowRoot`: The return value of the `attachShadow()` method is a **shadow root object**. This `shadowRoot` object is the root node of the newly created Shadow DOM tree. You can then use this `shadowRoot` object to add HTML elements, styles, and scripts within the encapsulated Shadow DOM.

**3. The Host's `shadowRoot` Property:**

The key part of the Author's statement is about what happens *in addition* to `attachShadow()` returning the `ShadowRoot` object. When you successfully call `attachShadow()` on a host element:

* The browser not only creates and attaches the Shadow DOM tree.
* It *also* sets the **`shadowRoot` property of the host element** to reference the newly created **`ShadowRoot` object**.

**Illustrative Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>attachShadow Explanation</title>
</head>
<body>

  <div id="myHost">This is the host element.</div>

  <script>
    const hostElement = document.getElementById('myHost');

    // Attach a Shadow DOM to the host element
    const shadowRoot = hostElement.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });

    // Now, hostElement has a shadowRoot property that points to 'shadowRoot'
    console.log("Returned ShadowRoot object:", shadowRoot);
    console.log("hostElement.shadowRoot property:", hostElement.shadowRoot);

    // You can now add content to the shadowRoot
    const paragraph = document.createElement('p');
    paragraph.textContent = "This content is inside the Shadow DOM.";
    shadowRoot.appendChild(paragraph);
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We get a reference to the `<div>` element with the ID `myHost`. This is our host element.
2.  We call `hostElement.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })`.
    * This creates a Shadow DOM tree attached to `myHost`.
    * The `mode: 'open'` allows us to access the Shadow DOM from outside.
    * The method returns the `ShadowRoot` object, which we store in the `shadowRoot` variable.
3.  The Author's point is that after this line executes, the `hostElement` now has a property named `shadowRoot`. The value of this `hostElement.shadowRoot` property is the *same* `ShadowRoot` object that was returned by the `attachShadow()` method.
4.  We then demonstrate accessing both the returned `shadowRoot` variable and the `hostElement.shadowRoot` property in the `console.log` statements. They will both refer to the same ShadowRoot object.
5.  Finally, we show how to add content to the Shadow DOM using the `shadowRoot` object. This content will be encapsulated within the Shadow DOM of the host element.

**Why is this dual access useful?**

* The returned `ShadowRoot` object allows you to immediately start working with the newly created Shadow DOM (adding elements, styles, etc.).
* The `hostElement.shadowRoot` property provides a way to access the Shadow DOM of a host element later in your code, especially if you need to manipulate it after the initial attachment. This is only possible if the `mode` was set to `'open'`. If the mode was `'closed'`, `hostElement.shadowRoot` would be `null`, preventing external access.

In essence, `attachShadow()` gives you a direct reference to the Shadow Root upon creation and also conveniently stores a reference to it on the host element itself (if the mode is `'open'`) for later use.
