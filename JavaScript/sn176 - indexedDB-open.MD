[G] Yes, that's correct. The `indexedDB.open("zipcodes", 1)` call will **create a new database named "zipcodes" if one does not already exist** in the user's browser for the origin of the web page making the request.

Here's a breakdown of what happens:

1.  **`indexedDB.open("zipcodes", 1)`**: This line attempts to open an IndexedDB database with the name "zipcodes" and version 1.

2.  **Browser Checks for Existing Database:** The browser will first check if a database named "zipcodes" already exists for the current origin (the domain, protocol, and port of the web page).

3.  **Database Doesn't Exist:** If no database named "zipcodes" is found:
    * IndexedDB will **create a new database** with that name.
    * The `upgradeneeded` event will be triggered. This event is crucial because it's the mechanism for setting up the database schema (creating object stores, indexes, etc.) for the first time or when the database version is being increased.

4.  **Database Exists:** If a database named "zipcodes" already exists:
    * The browser will compare the requested version (1 in this case) with the current version of the existing database.
    * **If the versions are the same:** The `success` event will be triggered directly, and you'll get a database object representing the existing database. The `upgradeneeded` event will *not* be triggered.
    * **If the requested version is higher than the current version:** The `upgradeneeded` event will be triggered before the `success` event. This allows you to update the database schema to the new version.
    * **If the requested version is lower than the current version:** This typically results in an error, and the `error` event will be triggered. IndexedDB generally doesn't allow you to directly downgrade a database.

**In summary:**

The `indexedDB.open()` method is idempotent in terms of database creation. If the specified database name doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, the behavior depends on the requested version compared to the existing version. The `upgradeneeded` event is your signal to initialize or update the database schema.

Therefore, you can rely on `indexedDB.open("zipcodes", 1)` to either open an existing "zipcodes" database (if at version 1) or to create a new one and trigger the `upgradeneeded` event where you would typically define your object stores and indexes.
