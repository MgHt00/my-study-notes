[G] That's a very logical guess, but it's **incorrect**.

When the `upgradeneeded` event is triggered (which happens when a database is created for the first time or when the version number in `indexedDB.open()` is higher than the existing database's version), the `request.result` will **not** be `null`.

Instead, `request.result` within the `onupgradeneeded` event handler will be the **newly created `IDBDatabase` object** (in the case of the first creation) or the **reference to the existing `IDBDatabase` object** that needs to be upgraded.

**Here's why:**

The `upgradeneeded` event is specifically designed to give you a chance to set up the database schema (create object stores, indexes, etc.) on the `IDBDatabase` object. You need a reference to this database object to perform these operations.

**Sequence of Events for First-Time Database Creation:**

1.  `indexedDB.open("yourDatabaseName", 1)` is called.
2.  The browser detects that "yourDatabaseName" doesn't exist.
3.  A new database is created internally.
4.  The `upgradeneeded` event is triggered.
5.  The `request` object associated with the `open()` call will have its `result` property set to the newly created `IDBDatabase` object *within the `onupgradeneeded` event handler*.
6.  You use `request.result` in your `initdb` function to create object stores and indexes.
7.  After the `onupgradeneeded` handler completes, the `success` event of the `request` will be triggered, and `request.result` in the `success` handler will also be the same `IDBDatabase` object.

**Why Your Guess Might Be Intuitive (But Wrong):**

You might be thinking that since the database didn't exist, there's no "result" yet. However, IndexedDB's design triggers `upgradeneeded` *during* the creation process, providing you with the object you need to configure the initial state.

**In the Author's Code:**

```javascript
request.onupgradedneeded = () => { initdb(request.result), callback }
```

* When the database is created for the first time (or upgraded), the `onupgradedneeded` handler is called.
* `request.result` inside this handler will be the `IDBDatabase` object.
* `initdb(request.result)` is then called to initialize the database schema on this newly created (or existing, being upgraded) database object.
* `callback` is also executed (though the comma operator means its return value isn't used).

**Therefore, to reiterate: When creating a database for the first time with `indexedDB.open()`, the `request.result` within the `onupgradedneeded` event handler will be the newly created `IDBDatabase` object, not `null`.** This is essential for setting up the initial structure of your database.
