The author is explaining a core difference between **static ES6 imports** and **dynamic imports** and why that difference matters for how code runs and is analyzed. Essentially, static imports happen before code execution, guaranteeing everything is ready.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### 1\. Static Nature of `import` and `export`

The `import` and `export` keywords are **static**. This means that when a JavaScript engine or a build tool (like Webpack or Rollup) sees a file with these directives, it can figure out all the dependencies just by looking at the code, without actually running any of it. This is a form of **text analysis** or static analysis.

  * **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // A.js
    import { something } from './B.js';
    console.log(something);
    ```
    The engine reads this file and immediately knows, "Okay, before I can run A.js, I need to go get B.js and find its `something` export." It doesn't have to wait for any `if` statements, function calls, or other runtime logic.

This static nature is a key reason why tools can perform optimizations like tree shaking (removing unused code).

### 2\. The Guarantee: Modules are Loaded and Ready

The second part of the author's statement explains the consequence of this static analysis: **the values you import will be ready for use before your code begins to run.**

Because the JavaScript engine resolves all `import` dependencies first, it ensures that by the time your module's code starts executing, all the modules it relies on have already been loaded, parsed, and executed themselves. This prevents runtime errors where a variable or function you've imported is `undefined` because its module hasn't finished loading yet.

**Think of it like this:**

  * **Static Import:** Imagine you're building a Lego set. The instruction booklet (your module) lists all the required pieces and where they come from (your imported modules). You're guaranteed to have all the pieces in front of you and ready to use before you even start building. You won't get halfway through and suddenly realize a crucial piece is missing.

  * **Dynamic Import (`import()`)**: This is the opposite. You're building your Lego set and realize you need a specific piece only when you get to a certain step in the instructions. You then have to go find and get that piece *at that moment*. This is great for performance (you only load what you need, when you need it), but you can't guarantee that the piece will be there before you start building.

This guarantee of readiness is a fundamental design principle of static ES6 modules. It makes module dependency management predictable and reliable.
