Concurrency means a program is handling multiple tasks at the same time. It's not the same as parallelism, which means executing multiple tasks simultaneously. Concurrency is more about managing and scheduling tasks so they appear to run at the same time, even if they're actually taking turns on a single processor.

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism

* **Concurrency:** A program is structured so it can work on multiple tasks at once. For example, a single chef might prepare several dishes by chopping vegetables for one, starting a pot of water for another, and then mixing ingredients for a third. They are making progress on all dishes by switching between them.

* **Parallelism:** Multiple tasks are actually running simultaneously. Using the same analogy, this would be having three chefs working at the same time on three separate dishes.

In JavaScript, this distinction is crucial because the main thread is single-threaded. Concurrency is achieved through mechanisms like the event loop, which handles asynchronous operations. Web Workers introduce a way to achieve a form of parallelism by allowing a new thread to run in the background, a new chef in our kitchen, but without sharing the kitchen's main utensils.

Can you also explain me what does 'so the concurrency is not detectable to the main thread' mean?

That statement refers to how **Web Workers** operate. It means that the tasks running on a separate thread (the worker) do not block or interfere with the main thread's execution, making the concurrency "invisible" from the main thread's perspective. üßë‚Äçüç≥

### The Main Thread and Concurrency

The **main thread** is where a browser's UI runs. This includes rendering the page, handling user input (like clicks and keystrokes), and running most of your JavaScript code. Because it's a single thread, if you perform a long-running, synchronous task on it, the entire user interface freezes and becomes unresponsive.

**Web Workers** were introduced to solve this problem. They are separate threads that run in the background.

When you start a task in a Web Worker, you:

1.  **Send a message** to the worker thread.
2.  The main thread is immediately free to continue its work (e.g., updating the UI, responding to clicks).
3.  The worker performs its task on its own thread.
4.  When the worker is done, it **sends a message back** to the main thread.

Because the main thread isn't waiting for the worker to finish, it doesn't "feel" the concurrency. From its point of view, it just sent a message and then later received a message, without ever stopping. The work in between‚Äîthe "concurrency"‚Äîis happening entirely out of sight on the separate worker thread.

So, when the author says "the concurrency is not detectable," they mean the main thread's responsiveness isn't affected. The heavy lifting is offloaded to a different thread, ensuring a smooth user experience.
