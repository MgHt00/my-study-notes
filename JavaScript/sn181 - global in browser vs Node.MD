In a web browser environment, the **global object is the `Window` object**. It can be referred to by the property `window` which is a property of the global object itself. This is why you can use `window` to access the global object. However, you generally cannot use the name `Global` to refer to it.

When it comes to Node.js, you're right. The **global object is named `global`**, and it is not called `Window`. This is a key difference between the two environments.

Here's a summary to clarify:

* **Browser:**
    * **The global object is the `Window` object.**
    * You can access it using the property `window`, which points to the global object.
    * You **cannot** use the name `Global` to access it.

* **Node.js:**
    * **The global object is the `global` object.**
    * You **cannot** use the name `Window` to access it.

To solve this naming inconsistency, the `globalThis` property was introduced. It's a universal way to access the global object in any JavaScript environment.

### The Modern Solution: `globalThis`

To solve this problem of different global object names across environments, the `globalThis` property was introduced in ECMAScript 2020. It's a universal way to access the global object, regardless of the environment your code is running in.

So, while `window.navigator` and `navigator` are the traditional ways to access it in a browser, you can also use `globalThis.navigator` to write code that works in both browsers and Web Workers, and other environments that support it.

| Environment | Global Object | Common Access Methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Browser** | `Window` | `window`, `self`, `frames`, `globalThis` |
| **Web Worker** | `WorkerGlobalScope` | `self`, `globalThis` |
| **Node.js** | `Global` | `global`, `globalThis` |

## The Global Object

In the browser, the **global object** is the top-level object of the JavaScript environment. All global variables and functions are properties of this object. For historical reasons and to ensure compatibility, this global object is named `Window`.

## `window` Property

The `window` property is a special property of the `Window` object that **points back to the `Window` object itself**. This means that `Window.window` refers to the same object as `Window`.

So, the hierarchy is as follows:

-   `Window` (the global object)
-   It has many properties, including:
    -   `document`
    -   `navigator`
    -   `setTimeout`
    -   `window` (which refers back to the `Window` object)

This is why `window.navigator` and `navigator` are both valid ways to access the `navigator` objectâ€”they're both accessing a property of the global `Window` object.
