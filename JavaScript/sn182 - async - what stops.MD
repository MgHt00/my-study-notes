Ah, I see the confusion. That's a very common point of misunderstanding when people first encounter asynchronous programming.

Your initial thought was that the program "stops," and that's technically correct, but the key detail is **what** stops. In an asynchronous model, the **main program flow does not stop**. What stops is a specific, single **task** that is waiting for something else to finish, like a file to be read or a network request to complete. 

Here's a better way to think about it:

### The One-Thread Model

Node.js is **single-threaded**. This means it only has one main worker. This worker is the one who handles all the tasks.

* **Synchronous:** The worker takes a task (e.g., read a large file from disk) and just stands there waiting for the file to be ready. It can't do anything else until that task is 100% complete. The **entire program** is effectively blocked and waiting.
* **Asynchronous:** The worker takes a task (e.g., read a large file) and tells the operating system, "Hey, let me know when this is done." Then, without waiting, the worker immediately goes on to the next task in the queue, like handling a new web request. When the file is ready, the operating system notifies the worker, and the worker comes back to handle the completed task. The **program as a whole remains active and responsive**.

So, your understanding was not entirely wrong, but it was missing the key detail: the "stop" is limited to the specific I/O operation, not the entire program.
