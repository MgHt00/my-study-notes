Let's clarify how the `sort()` function works step by step, focusing on how the values are assigned to `a` and `b` during each comparison.

### Initial Array:
```
[33, 4, 111, 222]
```

### Sorting Process:

The `sort()` function works by comparing two elements at a time. Let's denote them as `a` and `b`:

- **If `b - a` is positive:** It means `b > a`, so to sort in descending order, `a` should come after `b`.
- **If `b - a` is negative:** It means `b < a`, so to sort in descending order, `a` should stay before `b`.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Compare 33 and 4:**
   - Here, `a = 33` and `b = 4`.
   - `b - a = 4 - 33 = -29`.
   - Since the result is negative, **33 stays before 4**.
   - **Array state:** `[33, 4, 111, 222]`

2. **Compare 111 and 4:**
   - Now, `a = 4` and `b = 111`.
   - `b - a = 111 - 4 = 107`.
   - Since the result is positive, **111 comes before 4** (swap them).
   - **Array state:** `[33, 111, 4, 222]`

3. **Compare 111 and 33:**
   - Now, `a = 33` and `b = 111`.
   - `b - a = 111 - 33 = 78`.
   - Since the result is positive, **111 comes before 33** (swap them).
   - **Array state:** `[111, 33, 4, 222]`

4. **Compare 222 and 4:**
   - Now, `a = 4` and `b = 222`.
   - `b - a = 222 - 4 = 218`.
   - Since the result is positive, **222 comes before 4** (swap them).
   - **Array state:** `[111, 33, 222, 4]`

5. **Compare 222 and 33:**
   - Now, `a = 33` and `b = 222`.
   - `b - a = 222 - 33 = 189`.
   - Since the result is positive, **222 comes before 33** (swap them).
   - **Array state:** `[111, 222, 33, 4]`

6. **Compare 222 and 111:**
   - Now, `a = 111` and `b = 222`.
   - `b - a = 222 - 111 = 111`.
   - Since the result is positive, **222 comes before 111** (swap them).
   - **Array state:** `[222, 111, 33, 4]`

### Final Sorted Array:
```
[222, 111, 33, 4]
```

### Summary:
- The `sort()` function compares pairs of elements in the array.
- Each time, `a` is the current element being compared, and `b` is the next element in the list.
- Based on the result of `b - a`, the function determines whether to swap the elements to maintain descending order.

This process continues until all elements are sorted correctly in descending order. Does this explanation help clarify the sorting process?

--- 
A lot better now, does it mean, if swap is needed, the function is invoke backward until it reaches to the beginning of the array?

---
Yes, that's a great observation! 

When a swap is needed during sorting, the function may compare and potentially swap elements in a way that can feel like it's moving backward through the array. This process isn't exactly "invoking backward," but it does involve making comparisons and swaps that move elements towards their correct positions, which can involve multiple comparisons going back toward the start of the array.

### How It Works in Detail:

1. **Initial Comparisons:**
   - The sort function starts by comparing pairs of elements from the beginning of the array.
   - If a swap is needed, it will swap those elements.

2. **Bubble Up Larger Elements (Bubble Sort Analogy):**
   - If an element is found to be out of order compared to the elements before it, the sorting algorithm may "bubble" it backward (towards the beginning of the array) by repeatedly swapping it with earlier elements until it reaches its correct position.

3. **Insertion-like Behavior (Insertion Sort Analogy):**
   - The element is inserted into its proper place among the previously sorted elements. This insertion can involve moving the element back through the array until it's correctly placed.

### Example to Illustrate:

Let's consider a simpler array `[3, 1, 4, 2]`:

- **Compare 3 and 1**: 
  - Since `1 < 3`, swap them.
  - **Array after swap**: `[1, 3, 4, 2]`

- **Compare 3 and 4**: 
  - No swap needed because `3 < 4`.
  - **Array remains**: `[1, 3, 4, 2]`

- **Compare 4 and 2**: 
  - Since `2 < 4`, swap them.
  - **Array after swap**: `[1, 3, 2, 4]`
  - Now, `2` is in the wrong place, so...

- **Compare 3 and 2** (moving backward):
  - Since `2 < 3`, swap them.
  - **Array after swap**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

- **Final array is sorted**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

### Summary:

- When a swap is needed, the sorting function might need to go back through the earlier elements to ensure everything remains in the correct order.
- The element being "moved back" through the array helps ensure the entire array is sorted properly.

This backward movement isn't explicitly a "backward invocation" but rather a result of the comparison and swap mechanism in the sorting algorithm.
