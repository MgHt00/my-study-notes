Let's break down what the author is saying in that passage.

### Strings and Functions in JavaScript
- **Strings**: In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters. Each string has a `length` property, which returns the number of characters in the string.
- **Functions**: Functions also have a `length` property, but it doesn't refer to the number of characters. Instead, it represents the number of parameters the function expects.

### `typeof` Test
- The `typeof` operator in JavaScript is used to determine the type of a value. For example, `typeof "hello"` returns `"string"`, and `typeof function() {}` returns `"function"`.
- The author notes that even though strings and functions have `length` properties, they are not of the `object` type, which means when you use `typeof`, they will return `"string"` and `"function"`, not `"object"`.

### DOM Text Nodes and `nodeType`
- **DOM Text Nodes**: In client-side JavaScript (which runs in web browsers), you work with the Document Object Model (DOM). A text node is one type of DOM node that represents the text content in the HTML document.
- Text nodes also have a `length` property, which refers to the number of characters in the text node.

### Excluding Certain Types in a Check
- If you're writing code that checks for objects with a `length` property, you might not want to include strings, functions, or text nodes.
- **`o.nodeType !== 3`**: This checks if the object is a DOM text node. In the DOM, `nodeType` is a property that indicates the type of node. For text nodes, `nodeType` is `3`. By adding this check, you can exclude text nodes from your code logic if they’re not relevant to what you’re trying to do.

### Example Scenario
Let's say you're iterating over some objects and want to do something with their `length` property. You might want to ensure that the `length` property belongs to an array or an object, not a string, function, or text node.

```javascript
if (typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && typeof obj.length === 'number' && obj.nodeType !== 3) {
    // Do something with obj.length
}
```

This ensures that only objects with a numeric `length` property that are not text nodes are considered.
