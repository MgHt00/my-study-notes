In the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
let a = {"0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c", length: 3};
Array.prototype.join.call(a, "+");
Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase());
```

The reason the property names and values are in quotes is because they are treated as strings. Here's why:

### Property Names as Strings
1. **String Indexes**: The properties `"0"`, `"1"`, and `"2"` are not typical JavaScript array indexes; they are string keys that look like numbers. In JavaScript, object properties can be named with any string, so when you use numbers as property names, they are actually converted to strings (e.g., `0` becomes `"0"`). 
   
   In your example:
   ```javascript
   let a = {"0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c", length: 3};
   ```
   The properties `"0"`, `"1"`, and `"2"` are keys in the object `a`. If you omit the quotes, JavaScript would interpret `0`, `1`, and `2` as numbers, but since object property names must be strings, they get converted automatically.

2. **Consistency**: By using quotes around the property names, you're explicitly declaring them as strings, which makes it clear that these are not traditional array indices but rather object keys that happen to look like indices.

### Why the Property Values are in Quotes
The values `"a"`, `"b"`, and `"c"` are string values. In JavaScript, strings are enclosed in quotes (`"` or `'`). Without quotes, these values would be interpreted as variables, which would cause an error if those variables were not defined.

### Why This Matters for `Array.prototype` Methods
In the provided code:

- `Array.prototype.join.call(a, "+")`: This uses the `join()` method of arrays but applies it to an object `a`. Because `a` has properties that resemble an array (`"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`, and `length`), it can be treated like an array for the purpose of this method. The `join("+")` method will concatenate the values of `a`'s properties using `+` as a separator.
  
- `Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase())`: Similarly, this applies the `map()` function to the object `a`. It treats `a` as if it were an array and applies the `x => x.toUpperCase()` function to each value (`"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`), converting them to uppercase.

### Summary
- **Property Names**: In quotes to clearly define them as strings.
- **Property Values**: In quotes because they are strings.
- **Array Methods**: `Array.prototype` methods can be applied to objects that have a structure similar to arrays (i.e., with numeric keys and a `length` property).

If anything is still unclear, feel free to ask for further clarification!

<em>So does that mean whether the object names are in quotes or not, these functions will evoke as long as it resembles an array with numeric, aka strings, index, and length?"</em>

Yes, that's correct! 

Whether or not the property names (keys) are in quotes, as long as they resemble an array with numeric indices (which are actually strings) and a `length` property, functions like `Array.prototype.join()` and `Array.prototype.map()` can be invoked on the object.

### Explanation:
- **Property Names as Numbers**: When you define an object with numeric keys (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`), JavaScript automatically converts those numbers to strings behind the scenes. So whether you write:
  ```javascript
  let a = { 0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c", length: 3 };
  ```
  or
  ```javascript
  let a = { "0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c", length: 3 };
  ```
  The keys `"0"`, `"1"`, and `"2"` are treated the same way.

- **Array-Like Structure**: The object `a` has properties with keys that are strings resembling numeric indices, and it also has a `length` property. This structure is similar to an array, which allows `Array.prototype` methods to be applied.

### Examples:
Both of the following objects will work with `Array.prototype` methods:

1. **Without Quotes:**
   ```javascript
   let a = { 0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c", length: 3 };
   Array.prototype.join.call(a, "+"); // Output: "a+b+c"
   Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase()); // Output: ["A", "B", "C"]
   ```

2. **With Quotes:**
   ```javascript
   let a = { "0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c", length: 3 };
   Array.prototype.join.call(a, "+"); // Output: "a+b+c"
   Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase()); // Output: ["A", "B", "C"]
   ```

### Key Points:
- **Quotes or No Quotes**: The quotes around property names are optional when the keys are numeric. JavaScript will interpret unquoted numeric keys as strings.
- **Array-Like Object**: As long as the object has string keys resembling numeric indices and a `length` property, it can be treated as an array by these methods.

So yes, the functions will invoke as expected, regardless of whether the property names are quoted or not, as long as the object has a structure similar to an array!
