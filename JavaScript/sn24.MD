The syntax `f?.(x)` is an example of **optional chaining** in JavaScript, specifically when used with function calls. Here's how it works:

### Explanation:
- **Optional Chaining with Functions**: 
  - The `?.` operator is used to safely access properties, methods, or, in this case, functions that might not exist (i.e., they might be `null` or `undefined`).
  - In the expression `f?.(x)`, JavaScript checks if `f` is not `null` or `undefined` before attempting to call it as a function with the argument `x`.
  - If `f` is `null` or `undefined`, the entire expression evaluates to `undefined` without attempting the function call, thereby preventing a runtime error that would occur if you tried to call `null` or `undefined` as a function.
  - If `f` is a valid function, it gets invoked with `x` as its argument.

### Example:
```javascript
let f = null;
let result = f?.(42); // result is undefined because f is null

f = x => x * 2;
result = f?.(42); // result is 84 because f is a function and gets invoked
```

### Summary:
- **First Check**: The `f?.(x)` expression first checks if `f` is not `null` or `undefined`.
- **Function Invocation**: If `f` is a valid function, it is invoked with the argument `x`.
- **Short-circuiting**: If `f` is `null` or `undefined`, the function call does not occur, and the expression safely evaluates to `undefined`.

So, to answer your question: Yes, the optional chaining operator `?.` checks if `f` is neither `null` nor `undefined` before attempting to execute it as a function with its actual parameter `x`. If `f` is `null` or `undefined`, it skips the function call entirely.

So it means it only checks it is a function, not null, or not undefined; but does not execute all the codes in the function or check the return value.  Do I understand correctly?

Yes, you're absolutely correct!

The optional chaining operator `?.` only checks whether the function `f` is not `null` or `undefined`. If `f` is indeed a valid function, then it proceeds to execute that function with the provided argument(s). It does **not** pre-execute the function or check the return value before the function is actually called. 

So, in summary:
- `f?.(x)` checks if `f` is neither `null` nor `undefined`.
- If `f` is a function, it will execute that function with `x` as the argument.
- The operator does not run the function or evaluate its return value during the check. It only checks if the function exists (i.e., is not `null` or `undefined`).

If `f` is not a function (i.e., itâ€™s `null` or `undefined`), the function call is skipped, and the expression returns `undefined` without causing any errors.
