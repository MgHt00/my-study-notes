In the second line (`setRectSize(rect, width, height);`), the function `setRectSize` is not automatically "calling" the object `rect`â€”it's just passing the object `rect` as an argument along with `width` and `height`. It's up to the `setRectSize` function to decide what to do with that `rect` object.

Here's an example to clarify this:

```js
// Define a function that takes an object and two other parameters
function setRectSize(rect, width, height) {
  // Modify the properties of the passed-in object
  rect.width = width;
  rect.height = height;
}

// Create an object 'rect'
let rect = { width: 0, height: 0 };

// Call the function, passing the object and two additional arguments
setRectSize(rect, 50, 100);

console.log(rect); // Outputs: { width: 50, height: 100 }
```

In this example:
- The function `setRectSize` expects three arguments: an object (`rect`), `width`, and `height`.
- The object `rect` is passed as the first argument, but the function doesn't "automatically know" it's an object. It's just the first parameter, and the function assumes that it can modify `rect`'s properties.

The key thing is that the function `setRectSize` was designed to take an object as its first argument and modify it, but there's no automatic understanding of `rect` being an object unless the function explicitly handles it.
