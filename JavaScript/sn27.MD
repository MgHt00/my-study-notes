Absolutely! Let's break down those two lines of code one by one.

### 1. `let numbers = [5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1];`
This line declares a variable `numbers` and assigns it an array of numbers: `[5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1]`.

- The array contains several numbers: `5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1`.
- The variable `numbers` is now holding this array.

### 2. `Math.min(...numbers);`
This line is using the **spread operator** (`...`) to pass all the elements of the array `numbers` as individual arguments to the `Math.min()` function.

#### Here’s what happens step-by-step:

- **Spread Operator**: The three dots (`...`) before `numbers` is the **spread operator**. It takes an array (or any iterable) and "spreads" its elements out so that each element of the array is passed as a separate argument to the function. In this case:
  
  ```js
  Math.min(...numbers);
  ```

  is the same as:

  ```js
  Math.min(5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1);
  ```

- **Math.min()**: This is a built-in JavaScript function that returns the smallest value among the arguments passed to it. Normally, you would call it like this:

  ```js
  Math.min(5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1); // returns -1
  ```

#### Why use the spread operator?
Without the spread operator, you can’t directly pass an array to `Math.min()` because `Math.min()` expects individual numbers, not an array.

For example:

```js
Math.min(numbers); // This won't work. It returns NaN.
```

Using `Math.min(...numbers)` ensures that each element in the `numbers` array is passed as a separate argument, so it works as expected and returns the smallest number in the array, which is `-1` in this case.

### Summary:
- `let numbers = [5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1];` creates an array of numbers.
- `Math.min(...numbers);` uses the spread operator (`...`) to pass each number in the array as an individual argument to `Math.min()`, and then finds and returns the smallest number, which is `-1`.
