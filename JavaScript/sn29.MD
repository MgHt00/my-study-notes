Absolutely! Let's break down these two lines of code step by step:

```javascript
let a = [x => x*x, 20];
a[0](a[1]);
```

### First Line: `let a = [x => x*x, 20];`

- This line creates an array `a` with two elements.
  - The first element is a function: `x => x*x`. This is an arrow function that takes one argument `x` and returns the square of `x`.
  - The second element is the number `20`.

So, after this line, `a` looks like this:
```javascript
a = [function(x) { return x * x; }, 20];
```
Where `a[0]` is the function, and `a[1]` is the value `20`.

### Second Line: `a[0](a[1]);`

- This line calls the first element of the array, which is a function (`a[0]`), and passes the second element of the array (`a[1]`) as the argument to that function.

Breaking it down:
1. `a[0]` refers to the arrow function: `x => x*x`.
2. `a[1]` is the value `20`.
3. The function `x => x*x` is called with `a[1]` (which is `20`) as the argument.

So effectively, this is equivalent to calling:
```javascript
a ; // Which computes 20 * 20
```
The result of this expression would be `400`, because `20 * 20 = 400`.

### Summary:

- `a[0]` is a function that squares its argument.
- `a[1]` is the number `20`.
- `a[0](a[1])` calls the function `a[0]` with `20` as its argument, resulting in `400`.

This code takes the value `20`, squares it using the function, and returns `400`.
