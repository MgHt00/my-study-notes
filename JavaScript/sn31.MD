This example shows how you can define your own properties on a function in JavaScript. Let’s break it down:

### Code Explanation:

```javascript
uniqueInteger.counter = 0;
```
- This line adds a property called `counter` to the `uniqueInteger` function object and sets its initial value to `0`. In JavaScript, functions are objects, so they can have properties just like any other object.

```javascript
function uniqueInteger() {
  return uniqueInteger.counter++;
}
```
- This defines the function `uniqueInteger()`. When called, the function returns the current value of `uniqueInteger.counter`, and then increments the counter (`counter++`).

### What happens when you call `uniqueInteger()`?

1. The function looks at its `counter` property (which is `0` at the start).
2. It returns the current value of `uniqueInteger.counter`.
3. It then increments `uniqueInteger.counter` by 1 due to the post-increment operator (`counter++`).

### Example of how it works:

```javascript
uniqueInteger.counter = 0; // Initialize the counter

console.log(uniqueInteger()); // 0
console.log(uniqueInteger()); // 1
console.log(uniqueInteger()); // 2
console.log(uniqueInteger.counter); // 3 (since counter is incremented each time)
```

Each time you call `uniqueInteger()`, the counter increases and is returned.

This technique is useful for things like generating unique IDs, counters, or similar tasks where you need a value to increment on each function call.

The difference between using a **function's own property** and a **global variable** primarily revolves around **scope**, **encapsulation**, and **side effects**. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Scope**
   - **Global Variable**: A global variable is accessible from anywhere in your code once it is declared. It exists in the global scope, which means any function or piece of code can access and modify it.
   - **Function's Own Property**: A function's property is local to that function or accessible through the function itself, which helps avoid polluting the global scope. This means you can associate state or configuration directly with the function itself, instead of using global variables.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   // Global variable
   let counter = 0;
   
   function incrementCounter() {
       counter++; // Increments the global counter
   }

   // Function's own property
   function incrementCounterWithProperty() {
       incrementCounterWithProperty.counter++; // Uses a property tied to the function
   }
   incrementCounterWithProperty.counter = 0; // Initialize the property
   ```

   In the above code, `counter` is global and can be modified by any part of the code, while `incrementCounterWithProperty.counter` is tied directly to the function and is more contained.

### 2. **Encapsulation and Modularity**
   - **Global Variable**: Using global variables can make your program harder to manage, especially as your codebase grows, because they are accessible and modifiable from anywhere. This lack of encapsulation can lead to bugs if different parts of the program inadvertently modify the same global variable.
   - **Function's Own Property**: Associating state or data with a function using its property helps encapsulate that data within the function, making it less prone to unintended modifications from other parts of the program. This is useful for maintaining modularity and keeping code organized.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   // Global variable usage
   let state = "active";
   
   function toggleState() {
       state = (state === "active") ? "inactive" : "active";
   }

   // Function property usage
   function toggleStateWithProperty() {
       toggleStateWithProperty.state = (toggleStateWithProperty.state === "active") ? "inactive" : "active";
   }
   toggleStateWithProperty.state = "active";
   ```

   In the second case, `toggleStateWithProperty.state` is more modular and isolated.

### 3. **Side Effects**
   - **Global Variable**: Since global variables are accessible everywhere, changes to them can have unintended side effects in different parts of your program, making it difficult to track down bugs.
   - **Function's Own Property**: Using a function's property helps localize changes, reducing the chance of side effects. Other parts of the program cannot directly change the function's property unless they explicitly access the function itself.

### 4. **Reusability**
   - **Global Variable**: If a function depends on a global variable, it becomes less reusable. The function's behavior could change based on the current state of the global variable, which might not be ideal.
   - **Function's Own Property**: By tying state to the function's property, you make the function more self-contained and reusable. The function’s behavior will depend only on its own properties, not external global variables.

### Summary:
- **Global Variables**: Accessible from anywhere in the code, but can lead to issues like pollution of the global namespace, unintended side effects, and harder-to-maintain code.
- **Function's Own Property**: Encapsulates data with the function, making the code more modular, reducing the risk of side effects, and improving reusability.

By preferring function properties over global variables, you can make your code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.

<em>explicitly access means, accessing like this: toggleStateWithProperty.state = "active" ?</em>

Yes, exactly! "Explicitly accessing" in this case means accessing or modifying the property through the function itself, like this:

```javascript
toggleStateWithProperty.state = "active";
```

In this example, you are explicitly referencing the `toggleStateWithProperty` function and then accessing or modifying its `.state` property. This contrasts with a global variable, which can be accessed or modified anywhere without going through a specific function.

By explicitly accessing it through the function's property, you maintain control over when and how that value is changed. It is part of the encapsulation and modularity advantage of using function properties rather than global variables.
