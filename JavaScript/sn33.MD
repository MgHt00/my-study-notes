This concept refers to something called **"lexical scoping"** or **"closure"** in JavaScript. It means that when a function is defined, it remembers the scope (the variables and functions it has access to) at the point where it was created. Even if the function is invoked later in a different scope, it will still use the scope it had when it was defined, not the scope that exists when it's called.

Here’s a breakdown with an example:

### Example:
```javascript
function outer() {
    let x = 10;

    function inner() {
        console.log(x); // Accesses 'x' from the outer scope
    }

    return inner;
}

let myInnerFunc = outer(); // 'outer' is invoked, returning the 'inner' function
myInnerFunc(); // Logs 10, even though 'outer' has already finished executing
```

### Explanation:
1. **Definition of `outer()`**: When the `outer()` function is defined, it creates a variable `x` inside its scope and defines the `inner()` function.
   
2. **Definition of `inner()`**: The `inner()` function has access to `x` because it was defined inside `outer()`. This is lexical scoping—`inner()` can "see" the variables in its outer scope (i.e., the scope where it was defined).

3. **Invocation of `outer()`**: When you invoke `outer()`, it returns the `inner()` function but doesn't immediately execute it.

4. **Later invocation of `inner()`**: Even though `outer()` has finished executing by the time you call `myInnerFunc()`, the function `inner()` still "remembers" the scope where it was defined (i.e., the `x = 10` in `outer()`), and so it logs `10`.

### Key takeaway:
- When a function is defined, it captures the variables in the scope where it was created.
- Even if you invoke the function later, in a completely different scope, the function will still use the variables from its original scope.

This behavior allows JavaScript functions to **"remember"** the environment they were created in. This is the power of closures!

<em>In this code, why does "let myInnerFunc = outer()" not invoke inner()?</em>

The reason that `let myInnerFunc = outer()` does not invoke `inner()` is because, in this code, the `outer()` function returns the `inner()` function itself, but it doesn't immediately invoke it. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. `outer()` function
When you call `outer()`, it defines a local variable `x` (with a value of `10`) and defines the `inner()` function inside of it. The `inner()` function has access to the `x` variable in the outer scope.

At the end of `outer()`, you are **returning** the `inner()` function. However, you're not invoking it at this point—you're just returning it as a function.

### 2. `let myInnerFunc = outer();`
When you call `outer()`, it runs, and at the end of the function, it returns the `inner` function (but **does not** call `inner()`). So `myInnerFunc` now holds a reference to the `inner` function.

### 3. The `inner()` function
At this point, `myInnerFunc` is the `inner()` function, but it hasn't been called yet. To invoke the `inner()` function, you would need to do:

```javascript
myInnerFunc(); // Now it runs and logs '10'
```

### Key Point
- `outer()` returns the `inner()` function without invoking it.
- The function `inner()` is only invoked when you explicitly call `myInnerFunc()` after `outer()` has returned it.

The key concept here is **function returning functions**. By returning a function without invoking it, you create a closure that retains access to variables from the outer function (like `x` in this case).

---

<em>arr I see, if I want to invoke inner, I need to add inner() inside outer(), am I right?</em>

Yes, exactly! If you want to invoke `inner()` directly when `outer()` is called, you would need to call `inner()` inside `outer()`. Here's how you can do it:

### Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
    let x = 10;

    function inner() {
        console.log(x); // Accesses 'x' from the outer scope
    }

    inner(); // Invoke inner() inside outer()
}

outer(); // This will now invoke both outer() and inner()
```

### Breakdown:
- In this version, when you call `outer()`, the `inner()` function is invoked directly within `outer()`.
- This will result in `inner()` running immediately, and the value of `x` will be printed to the console when `outer()` is called.

### Output:
```
10
```

By adding `inner()` inside `outer()`, the `inner()` function will be invoked automatically whenever `outer()` is called.

Extended Question
---
Yes, you're absolutely right!

If there is **no `return` statement** in `outer()`, the inner function `inner()` will not be accessible outside of `outer()`. This is because the `inner()` function is defined **within** `outer()`, and without returning it or somehow exposing it, there is no way to call it from the outside.

Here's how it works:

### Example Without `return`:
```javascript
function outer() {
    let x = 10;

    function inner() {
        console.log(x); // Accesses 'x' from the outer scope
    }

    // No return statement here
}

let myInnerFunc = outer(); // 'outer' is invoked, but nothing is returned
myInnerFunc(); // This will cause an error, since myInnerFunc is undefined
```

### Explanation:
- **No return statement**: When `outer()` is called, the function `inner()` is defined and could access the variable `x`. However, since `inner()` is not returned (or made accessible in any other way), it is not available outside the `outer()` function.
- `myInnerFunc` will be `undefined` because `outer()` doesn’t return anything. As a result, calling `myInnerFunc()` will throw an error because `myInnerFunc` is not a function.

### What Happens with the Return Statement:
If you return `inner()` from `outer()`, it creates a closure, and you can access and invoke `inner()` from outside.

```javascript
function outer() {
    let x = 10;

    function inner() {
        console.log(x); // Accesses 'x' from the outer scope
    }

    return inner; // Returning the inner function
}

let myInnerFunc = outer(); // 'outer' is invoked, returning the 'inner' function
myInnerFunc(); // Logs 10
```

In this case, `myInnerFunc` holds the reference to the `inner()` function, and you can call it outside `outer()`.

---

The continuing statement is talking about the internal workings of **closures** in JavaScript, which is what makes lexical scoping work.

### Breakdown of the Statement:
1. **Lexical scoping implementation**:
   - Lexical scoping means that a function can access variables from the scope where it was defined, not where it is invoked.
   - To achieve this, JavaScript functions must store more than just their code when they are created.

2. **Function object and its internal state**:
   - When a function is created in JavaScript, it's not just a set of instructions or code.
   - Internally, it **remembers** the surrounding scope (or environment) where it was defined. This scope includes all the variables that were in scope at the time of the function’s creation.

3. **What is a closure?**:
   - A **closure** is the combination of:
     1. The **function object** itself (i.e., the code).
     2. The **scope/environment** where the function was created (i.e., a reference to all the variables that were accessible when the function was defined).
   - This combination allows the function to remember its lexical scope, even if it is invoked in a different scope later on.

### Example to Illustrate:

```javascript
function outer() {
    let count = 0; // A variable inside outer's scope

    function increment() {
        count++;  // Accesses the 'count' variable from the outer scope
        console.log(count);
    }

    return increment;
}

let myIncrement = outer();  // outer() returns the increment function
myIncrement();  // Logs 1
myIncrement();  // Logs 2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function creation and scope reference**: 
   - When `increment()` is defined inside `outer()`, it captures the `count` variable from the `outer()` scope.
   - Even though `outer()` has finished running, the `increment()` function **still remembers** the `count` variable. This is because `increment()` forms a **closure** that includes the function code and the surrounding scope (which contains `count`).

2. **How closures work**:
   - The `myIncrement()` function keeps accessing and modifying the `count` variable even though `outer()` has already executed and gone out of scope. The variable `count` is "remembered" because the closure keeps a reference to the scope where `increment()` was created.

3. **The closure includes a reference to the scope**:
   - When `outer()` returns `increment()`, it doesn't just return the function code, it also returns the **closure**, which contains both the code of `increment()` and the reference to the `count` variable from the `outer()` scope.

### Summary:
- When a function is created, JavaScript attaches not only the function's code but also a **reference** to the surrounding variables (scope).
- This combination of the function and the scope is called a **closure**.
- Closures allow functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created, even if they are called later in a different context.

This is a powerful feature in JavaScript, enabling you to create **persistent state** within functions, modularize code, and avoid polluting the global namespace.

 
More Complex Examples
---
I'm glad you're interested! Here's a more complex example that builds on the concept of using a function as a temporary namespace. In this example, we’ll simulate a more advanced module for managing a quiz system, including question generation, score tracking, and even allowing for resetting the quiz.

### Example 1: Quiz Manager with Temporary Namespace
```javascript
function QuizManager() {
  // Private variables and functions (inside the namespace)
  let questions = [
    { question: "What is the capital of Japan?", answer: "Tokyo" },
    { question: "What is the JLPT level for N1?", answer: "Advanced" },
    { question: "How many alphabets are in Japanese?", answer: "Three" }
  ];

  let currentQuestionIndex = 0;
  let score = 0;

  function askQuestion() {
    if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length) {
      let q = questions[currentQuestionIndex];
      console.log(`Question: ${q.question}`);
      return q.answer;  // We return the answer to simulate a user input check later
    } else {
      console.log("No more questions.");
    }
  }

  function checkAnswer(userAnswer) {
    let correctAnswer = questions[currentQuestionIndex].answer;
    if (userAnswer === correctAnswer) {
      console.log("Correct answer!");
      score++;
    } else {
      console.log(`Wrong answer. Correct answer was: ${correctAnswer}`);
    }
    currentQuestionIndex++;
  }

  function getScore() {
    console.log(`Your score is: ${score}`);
    return score;
  }

  function resetQuiz() {
    currentQuestionIndex = 0;
    score = 0;
    console.log("Quiz has been reset.");
  }

  // Public interface
  return {
    askQuestion,
    checkAnswer,
    getScore,
    resetQuiz
  };
}

// Using the namespace
let quiz = QuizManager();

// Example usage:
quiz.askQuestion();  // Displays first question
quiz.checkAnswer("Tokyo");  // User answers, and we check if it's correct
quiz.askQuestion();  // Displays second question
quiz.checkAnswer("Beginner");  // Wrong answer
quiz.getScore();  // Show current score

quiz.resetQuiz();  // Reset the quiz
quiz.askQuestion();  // Start from the beginning again
```

### Explanation:
1. **Private Variables and Functions**: Inside the `QuizManager` function, variables like `questions`, `currentQuestionIndex`, and `score` are not accessible outside of this function. This protects the state of the quiz, making it only manipulatable through the returned public methods.
  
2. **Public Interface**: The `return` statement inside `QuizManager` exposes only certain functions: `askQuestion`, `checkAnswer`, `getScore`, and `resetQuiz`. These are the only ways the outside world can interact with the quiz system. This is a basic example of **encapsulation** in JavaScript.

3. **Resetting State**: The `resetQuiz()` method allows you to reset the quiz, bringing `currentQuestionIndex` and `score` back to their initial values.

### Example 2: JLPT Vocabulary Quiz with Temporary Namespace and Event Handlers
Let’s simulate a more dynamic version with event handling, where you might want to hook up buttons for answering questions in your JLPT project.

```javascript
function JLPTQuizApp() {
  let questions = [
    { question: "What is the meaning of '猫'?", answer: "Cat" },
    { question: "What is the meaning of '犬'?", answer: "Dog" },
    { question: "What is the meaning of '車'?", answer: "Car" }
  ];

  let score = 0;
  let currentQuestionIndex = 0;

  function askNextQuestion() {
    if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length) {
      const q = questions[currentQuestionIndex];
      document.getElementById('question').textContent = q.question;
    } else {
      document.getElementById('question').textContent = "Quiz finished!";
      document.getElementById('answer-btn').disabled = true;
      document.getElementById('reset-btn').disabled = false;
    }
  }

  function submitAnswer() {
    let userAnswer = document.getElementById('answer').value;
    let correctAnswer = questions[currentQuestionIndex].answer;

    if (userAnswer === correctAnswer) {
      alert("Correct!");
      score++;
    } else {
      alert(`Wrong! The correct answer was ${correctAnswer}`);
    }
    
    currentQuestionIndex++;
    askNextQuestion();
  }

  function resetQuiz() {
    score = 0;
    currentQuestionIndex = 0;
    askNextQuestion();
    document.getElementById('answer-btn').disabled = false;
    document.getElementById('reset-btn').disabled = true;
  }

  return {
    startQuiz: askNextQuestion,
    checkAnswer: submitAnswer,
    reset: resetQuiz
  };
}

// Set up the quiz and event listeners
const quizApp = JLPTQuizApp();

document.getElementById('start-btn').addEventListener('click', quizApp.startQuiz);
document.getElementById('answer-btn').addEventListener('click', quizApp.checkAnswer);
document.getElementById('reset-btn').addEventListener('click', quizApp.reset);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Encapsulation**: Just like before, the variables like `questions`, `score`, and `currentQuestionIndex` are hidden inside the `JLPTQuizApp` function. You can interact with the quiz only through the returned functions.
  
2. **Event Handlers**: `startQuiz`, `checkAnswer`, and `reset` are tied to buttons using `addEventListener`. These functions manipulate the DOM and interact with the internal quiz state.

3. **State Management**: The state of the quiz is contained entirely within the `JLPTQuizApp` function. This ensures that the quiz logic is cleanly separated from the global scope and the rest of the app.

### Why Use This Approach?
In your JLPT project, using functions as temporary namespaces will help you avoid the risk of global variable name conflicts. It also improves modularity, making your code easier to maintain and test by keeping related logic together.

By using this technique, you can gradually build more complex, structured applications without overwhelming the global namespace or running into issues with variable overwrites.
