This is a great question! Let's break down the code and address both parts of your query.

### Code breakdown:
```javascript
let scope = "global scope";

function checkscope() {
    let scope = "local scope";

    function f() {
        return scope; // f accesses the scope variable from checkscope's scope
    }

    return f; // checkscope returns the function f, not its result
}

let s = checkscope()(); // Invoking checkscope, then immediately invoking f
```

### Why there's no `()` after `return f`

In the line `return f;`, you're returning **the function `f` itself**, not the result of calling `f`. This means `checkscope()` will return a **reference** to the `f` function, but it won't invoke `f` at that point.

To actually call the `f` function after it’s returned by `checkscope()`, you need to invoke it later, which is exactly what you're doing with `checkscope()()`.

### Why two pairs of `()` are needed: `checkscope()()`

Let's break it down:

1. **First `checkscope()` call:**
    - When you call `checkscope()`, it executes the function `checkscope`.
    - Inside `checkscope`, a local variable `scope` is set to `"local scope"`.
    - Then the inner function `f` is defined, which captures (or "closes over") the variable `scope` from `checkscope`’s scope.
    - Finally, the function `f` itself is returned by `checkscope`.

   So after calling `checkscope()`, you get a reference to the `f` function, but you haven’t executed it yet. At this point, `checkscope()` returns `f`.

2. **Second `()` after the returned function:**
    - The second `()` immediately calls the function `f` that was returned by `checkscope()`.
    - When `f` is invoked, it returns the value of `scope` from its closure. Since `scope` is `"local scope"`, `f` returns `"local scope"`.

### Putting it all together:
- `checkscope()` returns the function `f`.
- The second `()` calls `f`, which accesses the `scope` variable from the scope of `checkscope`, giving the value `"local scope"`.

### Visualizing the process step-by-step:
1. `checkscope()` is called:
   - It creates the `scope` variable with the value `"local scope"`.
   - It defines the function `f` and returns it.
   - So, after `checkscope()`, we have a reference to the `f` function.
   
2. `f()` is called (from `checkscope()()`):
   - `f` executes and returns the `scope` variable from `checkscope`'s scope, which is `"local scope"`.

### Final result:
- `let s = checkscope()();` first returns the `f` function and then immediately calls `f`.
- This results in `s` being assigned the value `"local scope"`.

I hope this clears up why there are two sets of parentheses and why the first `f` is returned without being called!

<em>I see, so this is the same as
```javascript
let s = checkscope();
s.f(); 
```
am I right?</em>

No, the two examples are actually different. Let's clarify the distinction between them:

### Your Original Code:
```javascript
let s = checkscope()();
```

This is **not the same** as:

```javascript
let s = checkscope();
s.f();
```

### Breakdown of the Original Code:
1. `checkscope()` is called, which returns the inner function `f`.
2. `()` immediately after `checkscope()` invokes the returned function `f`.

So, the two `()` in `checkscope()()` mean:
- The first `()` calls `checkscope()`, returning the function `f`.
- The second `()` calls the function `f` that was returned by `checkscope()`.

In other words, `checkscope()()` is directly invoking the function `f` that `checkscope` returns.

### The Alternate Code You Suggested:
```javascript
let s = checkscope();
s.f();
```

Here’s what happens:
1. `checkscope()` is called, which returns the function `f`.
2. The result of `checkscope()` is assigned to `s`. So `s` now holds the returned function `f`.
3. `s.f()` is trying to access a property `f` on `s`, which is not defined, so it would cause an error.

The two are **not equivalent** because in the original, you're directly invoking the function `f` after getting it from `checkscope()`. In the alternate code, you're mistakenly trying to call a property `f` on the result of `checkscope()` instead of invoking the function itself.

To make your alternate code work correctly, you'd want:
```javascript
let s = checkscope();  // Now 's' holds the function 'f'
s();                   // Call 's', which is the function 'f'
```
