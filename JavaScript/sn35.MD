Yes, you need to include `()` when you are invoking a method on an object. The parentheses `()` are required to execute the function. If you omit them, you are simply referencing the function itself rather than calling it.

Here's an example:

### Accessing a method with parentheses:
```javascript
let obj = {
  greet: function() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
};

console.log(obj.greet());  // "Hello!"
```

In this case, `obj.greet()` calls the `greet` function and outputs `"Hello!"`.

### Accessing the function without parentheses:
```javascript
let obj = {
  greet: function() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
};

console.log(obj.greet);  // [Function: greet]
```

Without the parentheses, `obj.greet` simply returns a reference to the function, not the result of the function.

So yes, to **invoke** the method, you need to include the parentheses `()`.

<em>So if I include a statement like "this._n++" in a method, and access it without parentheses, will _n increase +1?</em>

---

No, if you access a method without parentheses, the code inside the method (like `this._n++`) will not execute. The method will simply return a reference to the function, but it won't run the function or modify any values.

Here’s an example to clarify:

### Defining the object with a method:
```javascript
let obj = {
  _n: 0,
  increment: function() {
    this._n++;
    console.log(this._n);
  }
};

// Accessing the method without parentheses
console.log(obj.increment);  // Outputs: [Function: increment]
console.log(obj._n);         // _n is still 0 because the method did not run

// Accessing the method with parentheses
obj.increment();  // Outputs: 1 and _n is incremented
console.log(obj._n);  // Now _n is 1
```

### Summary:
- **Without parentheses**: `obj.increment` is just a reference to the method and doesn’t execute it.
- **With parentheses**: `obj.increment()` runs the method, which increments `this._n` and performs any other logic in the method.

So, if you want to increment `this._n`, you need to call the method with parentheses: `obj.increment()`.

<em>Is it the same with accessor properties, getter and setter?</em>

---

No, accessor properties (getters and setters) in JavaScript behave differently than regular methods. You **do not** need parentheses to access or invoke them. Here's how they work:

### 1. **Getter:**
- A getter is a function that behaves like a property.
- When you access a property with a getter, it automatically runs the getter function without needing parentheses.

### 2. **Setter:**
- A setter is also a function, but it's triggered when you assign a value to a property.
- You don't use parentheses to call it; assigning a value to the property automatically invokes the setter function.

### Example of Getter and Setter:

```javascript
let obj = {
  _n: 0,
  get value() {
    return this._n;  // Getter returns the current value of _n
  },
  set value(val) {
    this._n = val;   // Setter assigns a new value to _n
  }
};

// Using the getter (no parentheses required)
console.log(obj.value);  // Outputs: 0

// Using the setter (no parentheses required)
obj.value = 10;
console.log(obj.value);  // Outputs: 10
```

### Key Differences:
- **Getters and setters** act like properties (you access or assign without parentheses).
- **Regular methods** require parentheses to execute the code inside them.

### Comparison:

```javascript
// Regular method
obj.increment();  // Must use parentheses to execute

// Getter
console.log(obj.value);  // Automatically invokes the getter

// Setter
obj.value = 20;  // Automatically invokes the setter
console.log(obj.value);  // Now outputs: 20
```

In summary, with **getter and setter properties**, you don't need parentheses, as they are automatically invoked when you **access** or **assign** to the property. With **regular methods**, you must include parentheses to execute the function logic.

<em>So what is the point of using accessor property and what are the benefits of using them?</em>

---

Using accessor properties (getters and setters) in JavaScript has several benefits and use cases, which are primarily centered around controlling access to and manipulation of object properties. Here are the key points and advantages:

### 1. **Encapsulation and Data Protection:**
   - **Benefit:** Getters and setters allow you to **encapsulate** internal data and control how that data is accessed or modified. This is useful when you want to hide the internal implementation details.
   - **Example:** You can prevent direct modification of properties by providing controlled access.

   ```javascript
   let person = {
       _age: 25,
       get age() {
           return this._age;
       },
       set age(value) {
           if (value > 0 && value < 150) {
               this._age = value;
           } else {
               console.log('Invalid age');
           }
       }
   };

   person.age = 30;   // Sets the age to 30
   console.log(person.age);  // Outputs: 30

   person.age = 200;  // Outputs: Invalid age
   console.log(person.age);  // Outputs: 30
   ```

   **Explanation:** The `_age` property is encapsulated, and the setter ensures that only valid values can be assigned to it.

### 2. **Custom Logic on Access/Assignment:**
   - **Benefit:** You can run custom code when a property is read (getter) or written to (setter), allowing for validation, logging, transformations, or lazy calculations.
   - **Example:** Lazy calculation using a getter.

   ```javascript
   let circle = {
       _radius: 10,
       get diameter() {
           return this._radius * 2;
       }
   };

   console.log(circle.diameter);  // Outputs: 20 (calculated dynamically)
   ```

   **Explanation:** The getter allows you to compute `diameter` dynamically based on `radius`, instead of storing it as a separate property.

### 3. **Making Properties Read-Only or Write-Only:**
   - **Benefit:** You can use only a getter to make a property **read-only** or only a setter to make it **write-only**.
   - **Example:** Making a property read-only.

   ```javascript
   let obj = {
       _id: 123,
       get id() {
           return this._id;
       }
   };

   obj.id = 456;  // Won't have any effect
   console.log(obj.id);  // Outputs: 123
   ```

   **Explanation:** Here, `id` is read-only because there's no setter, so any attempt to modify it has no effect.

### 4. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - **Benefit:** You can add getters and setters to an existing object without changing its external API, ensuring backward compatibility.
   - **Example:** If you originally stored a property directly and later wanted to change how it's computed or validated, you can replace it with an accessor without breaking existing code that reads or writes to that property.

### 5. **Derived or Computed Properties:**
   - **Benefit:** Getters allow you to create **computed properties** based on other properties without needing to store the result.
   - **Example:** Calculating the total cost based on individual item costs.

   ```javascript
   let cart = {
       items: [10, 20, 30],
       get total() {
           return this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item, 0);
       }
   };

   console.log(cart.total);  // Outputs: 60
   ```

   **Explanation:** The `total` is derived from the `items` array, and it updates dynamically whenever `items` change.

### 6. **Cleaner Syntax:**
   - **Benefit:** Accessor properties allow a **cleaner syntax** for getting and setting values, compared to using explicit getter and setter methods (with parentheses).
   - **Example:** Instead of `person.getAge()` and `person.setAge(30)`, you can simply use `person.age` and `person.age = 30`.

### 7. **Consistent API:**
   - **Benefit:** Getters and setters provide a **consistent API** that looks like property access but allows you to insert logic behind the scenes without changing how the object is used by other code.

### 8. **Compatibility with Existing Code:**
   - **Benefit:** Since you access them like regular properties, getters and setters work seamlessly with existing JavaScript code that expects objects with properties.

### Summary of Benefits:
- **Encapsulation:** Hide and protect internal data.
- **Control:** Validate or modify data during assignment or retrieval.
- **Dynamic Properties:** Compute property values on the fly.
- **Read-Only/Write-Only:** Control access level to certain properties.
- **Cleaner API:** Avoid having explicit getter/setter method calls.
- **No Redundant Storage:** No need to store computed values in memory.

### Example:

```javascript
let rectangle = {
   _width: 10,
   _height: 20,
   get area() {
       return this._width * this._height;  // Compute area dynamically
   },
   set width(value) {
       if (value > 0) {
           this._width = value;
       } else {
           console.log("Invalid width");
       }
   }
};

console.log(rectangle.area);  // Outputs: 200
rectangle.width = 15;         // Updates width
console.log(rectangle.area);  // Outputs: 300
```

Here, the `area` is dynamically calculated, and you control the width using the setter.

Accessor properties provide a powerful mechanism to control property access while keeping the syntax simple and intuitive.
