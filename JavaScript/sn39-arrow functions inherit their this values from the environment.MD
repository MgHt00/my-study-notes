Yes, the statement that **arrow functions inherit their `this` values from the environment in which they are defined** and that their `this` value cannot be overridden with `bind()` is a key feature of arrow functions in JavaScript.

Unlike regular functions, which can have their `this` value dynamically set depending on how they are invoked, arrow functions **lexically capture** the `this` value from the surrounding context where they are defined. This means that `this` inside an arrow function will always refer to the `this` of the outer function or environment in which the arrow function is created, and calling `bind()` on an arrow function will have no effect.

### Example of Arrow Function's `this` Behavior

Letâ€™s look at an example that illustrates this concept:

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    regularFunction: function() {
        console.log("Regular function this:", this);  // 'this' refers to the 'person' object
    },
    arrowFunction: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function this:", this);  // 'this' refers to the outer scope, not 'person'
    }
};

person.regularFunction();  // 'this' refers to 'person' object
person.arrowFunction();    // 'this' refers to the outer scope (likely the global object in non-strict mode)
```

**Explanation:**
- `regularFunction` is a normal function, so its `this` refers to the `person` object because it was called as a method of `person`.
- `arrowFunction` is an arrow function. Its `this` does not refer to the `person` object, but to the environment in which the arrow function was defined, which is the outer scope. In this case, it will refer to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) instead of the `person` object.

### Arrow Functions and `bind()`

Now, let's try to use `bind()` on an arrow function and see what happens:

```javascript
const obj1 = {
    name: "Object 1",
};

const obj2 = {
    name: "Object 2",
    arrowFunc: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function this:", this.name);  // 'this' comes from the outer scope
    },
};

const boundFunc = obj2.arrowFunc.bind(obj1);
boundFunc();  // 'this' is not bound to 'obj1', it still refers to the outer scope
```

**Explanation:**
- We define an arrow function `arrowFunc` inside `obj2`.
- The arrow function does not use `this` from `obj2`. Instead, it inherits `this` from the environment where it was defined, which could be the global object or another outer scope.
- When we try to use `bind()` to change the `this` value of `arrowFunc` to `obj1`, it has **no effect** because arrow functions donâ€™t allow their `this` to be changed using `bind()`. The arrow function still refers to the outer scope's `this`.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Arrow functions** do not have their own `this` context. They "inherit" the `this` from the scope in which they are defined.
- Using `bind()`, `call()`, or `apply()` on an arrow function will **not** change its `this` value, as `this` is permanently set based on the lexical environment.
- This makes arrow functions particularly useful in situations like event handlers, callbacks, or when you want to avoid issues related to dynamically changing `this`.

### 4th - 22 Jan 25

Two months ago, you told me that "...arrow functions inherit their this values from the environment in which they are defined and that their this value cannot be overridden with bind() is a key feature of arrow functions in JavaScript.... 

This means that this inside an arrow function will always refer to the this of the outer function or environment in which the arrow function is created, and calling bind() on an arrow function will have no effect."

With this code, 
```javascript
const obj1 = {
    name: "Object 1",
};

const obj2 = {
    name: "Object 2",
    arrowFunc: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function this:", this.name);  // 'this' comes from the outer scope
    },
};

const boundFunc = obj2.arrowFunc.bind(obj1);
boundFunc();
```

What I understand is that arrow function arrowFunc is defined inside obj2, so that the this of the arrow function can inherit the value where it defined and inherit Object 2. 

But I was wrong, I guess.  Can you teach me where did I go wrong?

You're on the right track in understanding that arrow functions inherit their `this` value from their defining environment. However, let's break down the behavior of your example to clarify where things might be confusing.

### Understanding the Code:

```javascript
const obj1 = {
    name: "Object 1",
};

const obj2 = {
    name: "Object 2",
    arrowFunc: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function this:", this.name);  // 'this' comes from the outer scope
    },
};

const boundFunc = obj2.arrowFunc.bind(obj1);
boundFunc();
```

1. **Arrow Function Context**: 
   - `arrowFunc` is an arrow function inside `obj2`.
   - Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context, which in this case, is the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) since the arrow function is not defined within any other function or class.

2. **`this` in `arrowFunc`**:
   - When `arrowFunc` tries to access `this.name`, it doesn't find `this` bound to `obj2`. Instead, `this` refers to the outer environment's `this`, which is the global object (`window` in browsers) or `undefined` in strict mode, depending on the execution context.

3. **Using `bind`**:
   - You attempt to use `bind` on `arrowFunc` with `obj1`. However, since arrow functions do not have their own `this` and can't be re-bound to a different `this` context, the call to `bind` has no effect.
   - `boundFunc` still behaves the same as `arrowFunc`, which means it still inherits the `this` from the outer environment and not from `obj1`.

### Key Points:

- Arrow functions inherit `this` from their lexical scope, not from the object they are defined in.
- `bind`, `call`, or `apply` do not change the `this` value for arrow functions.
- In your example, `this.name` inside `arrowFunc` is `undefined` because `this` refers to the global object or `undefined` (in strict mode) and not to `obj2` or `obj1`.

To see the difference with a regular function:

```javascript
const obj2 = {
    name: "Object 2",
    regularFunc: function() {
        console.log("Regular function this:", this.name);  // 'this' is bound to obj2
    },
};

obj2.regularFunc(); // Logs: Regular function this: Object 2

const boundRegularFunc = obj2.regularFunc.bind(obj1);
boundRegularFunc(); // Logs: Regular function this: Object 1
```

In this case, `bind` works as expected with a regular function because regular functions have their own `this` that can be re-bound.

Would you like to try modifying the code with a regular function to see the difference?

Arr I see, the object does not count as the outer scope, I guess.  Even though the arrow function was in the object, the object is not count as the outer scope, so that this is the global object.  Did I get it right? :)

---

Yes, you got it exactly right! ðŸŽ‰

The key point is that **the surrounding lexical context** for an arrow function refers to where it is defined, not necessarily where it is called from. In this case, even though the arrow function is inside `obj2`, the `this` value is determined by where the function is *defined*, not by the object it is inside.

Since the arrow function is defined in the global context (i.e., directly within `obj2` and not inside another function or class), it inherits `this` from the global context. So when you use `bind()`, it doesn't change `this` for arrow functions, and it defaults to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode.

You're absolutely correct in thinking that the object does not count as the "outer scope" in this case, and that's what makes arrow functions unique!

If you want the `this` value to refer to the object (like `obj2` or `obj1`), you would need to use a **regular function** instead of an arrow function. Would you like to see how to change this code to use a regular function?

I'm glad you're happy! ðŸ˜„

Sure, let's look at an example of an arrow function **inside another function or class**, where the `this` value will refer to the **outer function's** or **class's context**. This demonstrates how arrow functions inherit `this` from the surrounding scope.

### Arrow function inside another function:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    this.name = "Outer Function";

    // Arrow function inside outerFunction
    const innerArrowFunc = () => {
        console.log(this.name); // `this` refers to the `outerFunction`'s context
    };

    innerArrowFunc();
}

const obj = { name: "Object" };
obj.outerFunction = outerFunction;
obj.outerFunction();  // Logs "Outer Function"
```

Here, the arrow function `innerArrowFunc` inherits `this` from `outerFunction`, so when it's invoked, it logs `"Outer Function"`. If you used a regular function instead of an arrow function, `this` would refer to `obj` if called through `obj.outerFunction()`.

### Arrow function inside a class:

```javascript
class MyClass {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    method() {
        // Arrow function inside method
        const innerArrowFunc = () => {
            console.log(this.name); // `this` refers to the class instance
        };

        innerArrowFunc();
    }
}

const myObj = new MyClass("MyClass Object");
myObj.method();  // Logs "MyClass Object"
```

In this case, the arrow function `innerArrowFunc` inherits `this` from the class instance (`myObj`), so it logs `"MyClass Object"`.

### Key Points:
- In both examples, the arrow functions inside the outer function or class methods **inherit `this`** from the scope in which they are defined (i.e., `outerFunction` or the class instance).
- If we used a **regular function** instead of an arrow function, `this` would behave differently, depending on how the function is called (e.g., it could refer to the global object or the object the method is called on).
