Yes, the statement that **arrow functions inherit their `this` values from the environment in which they are defined** and that their `this` value cannot be overridden with `bind()` is a key feature of arrow functions in JavaScript.

Unlike regular functions, which can have their `this` value dynamically set depending on how they are invoked, arrow functions **lexically capture** the `this` value from the surrounding context where they are defined. This means that `this` inside an arrow function will always refer to the `this` of the outer function or environment in which the arrow function is created, and calling `bind()` on an arrow function will have no effect.

### Example of Arrow Function's `this` Behavior

Let’s look at an example that illustrates this concept:

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    regularFunction: function() {
        console.log("Regular function this:", this);  // 'this' refers to the 'person' object
    },
    arrowFunction: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function this:", this);  // 'this' refers to the outer scope, not 'person'
    }
};

person.regularFunction();  // 'this' refers to 'person' object
person.arrowFunction();    // 'this' refers to the outer scope (likely the global object in non-strict mode)
```

**Explanation:**
- `regularFunction` is a normal function, so its `this` refers to the `person` object because it was called as a method of `person`.
- `arrowFunction` is an arrow function. Its `this` does not refer to the `person` object, but to the environment in which the arrow function was defined, which is the outer scope. In this case, it will refer to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) instead of the `person` object.

### Arrow Functions and `bind()`

Now, let's try to use `bind()` on an arrow function and see what happens:

```javascript
const obj1 = {
    name: "Object 1",
};

const obj2 = {
    name: "Object 2",
    arrowFunc: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function this:", this.name);  // 'this' comes from the outer scope
    },
};

const boundFunc = obj2.arrowFunc.bind(obj1);
boundFunc();  // 'this' is not bound to 'obj1', it still refers to the outer scope
```

**Explanation:**
- We define an arrow function `arrowFunc` inside `obj2`.
- The arrow function does not use `this` from `obj2`. Instead, it inherits `this` from the environment where it was defined, which could be the global object or another outer scope.
- When we try to use `bind()` to change the `this` value of `arrowFunc` to `obj1`, it has **no effect** because arrow functions don’t allow their `this` to be changed using `bind()`. The arrow function still refers to the outer scope's `this`.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Arrow functions** do not have their own `this` context. They "inherit" the `this` from the scope in which they are defined.
- Using `bind()`, `call()`, or `apply()` on an arrow function will **not** change its `this` value, as `this` is permanently set based on the lexical environment.
- This makes arrow functions particularly useful in situations like event handlers, callbacks, or when you want to avoid issues related to dynamically changing `this`.
