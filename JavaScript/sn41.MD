In the example you provided:

```javascript
const f = function fact(x) {
    if (x <= 1) return 1;
    else return x * fact(x - 1);
};
```

The function expression is assigned to the constant `f`, but the function itself has a name: `fact`. This function name (`fact`) is only accessible **within** the function body, which is why the statement says, "the function name becomes a local variable."

Here's the breakdown:

1. **The outer scope**: The name `fact` is **not** accessible outside the function. You can only refer to the function using `f` from the outside.

2. **The inner scope**: Inside the function, however, the name `fact` refers to the function itself. This is why it can call itself recursively by using `fact(x - 1)`.

So, the name `fact` is essentially a "local variable" within the function, and it's bound to the function object itself. This allows the function to refer to itself without relying on the outer `f` variable.

### Why does this matter?
If you use the function name inside its body, like for recursion, the function can still call itself even if it's assigned to a different variable or no longer accessible from outside. It isolates the function from the outer scope in a sense, making it more self-contained.

Here's an example to make it clearer:

```javascript
const g = f;
f = null;

console.log(g(5));  // Outputs 120
```

Even after setting `f` to `null`, the function `g` (which points to the same function object) can still call itself because it refers to itself using `fact` inside the function, not `f`.

### Summary:
- The function name `fact` is a **local variable** inside the function itself.
- You can use it for recursion or to refer to the function from inside itself.
- Outside the function, only `f` (the variable it's assigned to) can access the function.

Let’s walk through more examples to help clarify how the function name acts as a local variable within the function and how it still works even after assigning `null` to the outer variable `f`.

### Example 1: Function name inside the function (recursion)

```javascript
const f = function fact(x) {
    if (x <= 1) return 1;
    else return x * fact(x - 1);  // Recursively calls fact()
};

const g = f;  // Assign the function to another variable 'g'
f = null;     // Set 'f' to null

console.log(g(5));  // Outputs 120
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Before setting `f = null`**, the function `fact` is assigned to the variable `g`. Inside the function, the `fact` name is a local reference to the function itself.
2. When you set `f = null`, you're breaking the outer reference to the function, but the function name `fact` **inside** the function still exists as a local variable. That’s why when you call `g(5)`, it can still execute the recursion correctly, because inside the function, the recursive call is using the name `fact`, not `f`.

Thus, the function works, even after setting `f` to `null`, because the local name `fact` still points to the function.

### Example 2: The importance of the local function name

```javascript
const f = function fact(x) {
    if (x <= 1) return 1;
    else return x * fact(x - 1);  // Uses fact() for recursion
};

const g = f;  // Another reference to the same function
f = null;     // 'f' is now null

console.log(f);  // Outputs null
console.log(g);  // Outputs the function

console.log(g(3));  // Outputs 6 (3 * 2 * 1)
```

#### Key Points:
- **`f = null`**: After this, the `f` variable no longer holds the function, but this doesn’t affect the function itself. The function object still exists in memory, and `g` holds a reference to it.
- **Recursion works through `fact`**: Even when `f` is `null`, the recursive function can still call itself through `fact`.

### Example 3: Without the local function name

Here’s an example without naming the function. If the function didn’t have the local name, the behavior would be different.

```javascript
const f = function(x) {   // No local name like 'fact'
    if (x <= 1) return 1;
    else return x * f(x - 1);  // Tries to use 'f' for recursion
};

const g = f;
f = null;

console.log(g(5));  // Throws error: Cannot read property 'call' of null
```

#### Why does it fail?

- In this case, the function does not have a local name like `fact`, so it tries to use `f` for recursion. But since `f` is `null`, the recursion fails when `g(5)` tries to call `f(x - 1)` on the second iteration.**

<em>Yes, you're absolutely right—my initial statement was incorrect. The recursion fails on the **first recursive attempt**, not the second iteration. 

Thank you for prompting the re-evaluation! The error indeed occurs immediately when `g(5)` tries to call `f(4)`, as `f` has already been set to `null`.</em>

### Example 4: Using a named function expression for recursion

```javascript
const f = function fib(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);  // Recursive call using 'fib'
};

const g = f;
f = null;

console.log(g(6));  // Outputs 8 (fib(6) = 8)
```

In this case:
- The function is named `fib` inside its body. Even though `f` is set to `null`, `g(6)` works because `fib` refers to the function, allowing it to recurse correctly.

### Key Takeaways:
1. The **function name** inside a function expression is a local reference to the function itself, independent of any outer variable (like `f` in these examples).
2. If you remove or overwrite the outer variable, the function can still call itself as long as it has a name inside its body (like `fact` or `fib`).
3. Without a local function name, recursive calls must rely on an outer reference, and if that reference is `null` or changed, it will fail.

Let me know if you'd like more clarity on any part of this!
