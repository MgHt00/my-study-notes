The concept of "method chaining" means that when a method returns an object (usually the same object), you can immediately call another method on that returned object in the same line. This allows you to string together several method calls into a single expression. This is often used to write more concise and readable code, especially in libraries and frameworks like jQuery.

Let me break it down with an example:

### Example without method chaining:
```javascript
let obj = {
  value: 0,
  increment: function() {
    this.value++;
    return this;  // Return the object itself
  },
  double: function() {
    this.value *= 2;
    return this;  // Return the object itself
  },
  getValue: function() {
    return this.value;
  }
};

// Call methods separately
obj.increment();
obj.double();
console.log(obj.getValue()); // Output: 2
```

### Example with method chaining:
In method chaining, each method returns the object itself, allowing you to "chain" multiple method calls together:

```javascript
// Method chaining
console.log(obj.increment().double().getValue()); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation:

- In the **non-chained version**, we have to call each method separately on the object. The method just modifies the object but doesnâ€™t return anything useful for chaining.
  
- In the **chained version**, since `increment()` and `double()` return the object (`this`), after calling `increment()`, the object is returned, so we can immediately call `double()` on it. Then we can call `getValue()` to retrieve the final result. This allows us to write it all in a single expression: `obj.increment().double().getValue()`.

### How it works:
- **First, `increment()`**: This increments `value` by 1 and returns the object itself.
- **Next, `double()`**: This multiplies `value` by 2 and returns the object itself.
- **Finally, `getValue()`**: This returns the current value of `value`.

### Benefits of Method Chaining:
1. **Concise Code**: Instead of writing several lines, you can perform multiple operations in one line.
2. **Readability**: It can make the code easier to read, especially when there are multiple operations on the same object.
3. **Efficiency**: Less need for intermediate variables or steps.

Method chaining is a common pattern in libraries and frameworks where you need to apply multiple methods on the same object. For instance, in jQuery, you can write something like this:

```javascript
$('#myDiv').addClass('highlight').fadeIn().slideUp();
```

Here, jQuery returns the same object at every step so you can chain multiple operations together.

<em>Thank you, I understand clearly now.  In this code, if we do not explicitly return "this" the object, it will return "undefined" and method chaining will not work, do I understand correctly?</em>

---

Yes, you understand correctly! 

In method chaining, if you donâ€™t explicitly return the object (`this`) from a method, the method will return `undefined` (the default return value of a function that doesn't return anything). When this happens, you wonâ€™t be able to chain another method call because `undefined` is not an object, and trying to invoke a method on it would cause an error.

For example:

### Without returning `this`:
```javascript
let obj = {
  value: 0,
  increment: function() {
    this.value++;
    // No return statement
  },
  double: function() {
    this.value *= 2;
    // No return statement
  },
  getValue: function() {
    return this.value;
  }
};

// This will fail
obj.increment().double().getValue(); // Error: Cannot read property 'double' of undefined
```

Here, since `increment()` doesnâ€™t return the object (`this`), it returns `undefined`. When you try to chain `.double()` after `.increment()`, it tries to call `double()` on `undefined`, which causes an error.

### With returning `this`:
```javascript
let obj = {
  value: 0,
  increment: function() {
    this.value++;
    return this;  // Now it returns the object, enabling chaining
  },
  double: function() {
    this.value *= 2;
    return this;
  },
  getValue: function() {
    return this.value;
  }
};

// Method chaining works
console.log(obj.increment().double().getValue()); // Output: 2
```

Here, because `increment()` and `double()` return `this`, you can successfully chain the method calls.

So, to summarize:
- If you donâ€™t return `this`, the method will return `undefined`, breaking the chain.
- Returning `this` allows the next method in the chain to be called on the same object.

<em>The authors continue: "When you write a method that does not have a return value of its own, consider having the method return this.  If you do this consistently throughout your API, you will enable a style of programming known as method chaining" 

Does that mean the authors suggest to build a habit of returning "this" whenever there is nothing to return in methods?</em>

---

Yes, exactly! The authors are suggesting that if a method doesn't naturally have a return value (for example, it's just performing some action like updating an object property), you should consider returning `this`. By returning `this`, you're essentially returning the current object, allowing the method to be part of a method chain.

This can be useful when you want to build a fluent API, where multiple methods can be called in sequence on the same object. It enhances readability and reduces the need to repeatedly reference the object in each method call.

For example:

```javascript
let calculator = {
  operand1: 1,
  operand2: 1,
  
  setOperand1(value) {
    this.operand1 = value;
    return this; // returning this for chaining
  },
  
  setOperand2(value) {
    this.operand2 = value;
    return this; // returning this for chaining
  },
  
  add() {
    this.result = this.operand1 + this.operand2;
    return this; // returning this for chaining
  },
  
  showResult() {
    console.log(this.result);
    return this; // returning this for chaining
  }
};

// Method chaining
calculator.setOperand1(5).setOperand2(3).add().showResult(); // Output: 8
```

In this example, returning `this` from each method allows chaining all the method calls into one line. If any of the methods didn't return `this`, the chain would break, and you'd have to call each method separately on the object.

The idea is to build a habit of returning `this` in cases where there isn't a natural return value so that chaining becomes easier and more flexible.
