<em>Parameter default expressions are evaluated when your function is called, not when it is defined, so each time this getPropertyNames() function is invoked with one argument, a new empty array is created and passed.

Does it mean there will be more than one variable with the same name 'a' in memory?</em>

Great question! When the `getPropertyNames()` function is invoked multiple times with one argument, each time it creates a new array for the `a` parameter (because of the default value `a = []`). However, there won't be multiple variables with the same name "a" in memory at the same time.

Here’s what happens:

- Each time the function is called, the `a` parameter is treated as a **local** variable inside that specific function call.
- If `getPropertyNames()` is invoked again, the function creates a new instance of the local variable `a` (with a new empty array if no second argument is provided). This new `a` has nothing to do with the previous one, so they don’t conflict.
- Once the function call completes, the memory for `a` will eventually be cleaned up by the JavaScript engine's garbage collector (unless references to it persist elsewhere).

So while multiple function calls create different `a` variables (each associated with a different function call), they don't interfere with one another, and they exist independently in memory during their respective executions.

Would you like to see an example to help clarify this?
