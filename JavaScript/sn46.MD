Yes, if you replace `var` with `let` in the loop, `funcs[5]()` will indeed return `5` instead of `10`. Let's break down why this happens.

### Code with `var`:
```javascript
function constfuncs() {
    let funcs = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        funcs[i] = () => i; // Captures `i` from the outer scope
    }
    return funcs;
}

let funcs = constfuncs();
console.log(funcs[5]()); // 10
```

#### Why does this return `10`?
- When you use `var`, the variable `i` is **function-scoped**, not block-scoped.
- This means there is **only one `i` variable** shared across all iterations of the loop.
- By the time the loop finishes, `i` has a final value of `10` because the loop increments it until `i < 10` is no longer true.
- Since the functions stored in `funcs[]` all reference the same `i`, when you call any of them, they all return the final value of `i`, which is `10`.

### Code with `let`:
```javascript
function constfuncs() {
    let funcs = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        funcs[i] = () => i; // Captures `i` from the block scope
    }
    return funcs;
}

let funcs = constfuncs();
console.log(funcs[5]()); // 5
```

#### Why does this return `5`?
- When you use `let`, the variable `i` is **block-scoped**.
- Each iteration of the loop has its **own unique `i`** because `let` creates a new binding for each block (iteration of the loop).
- So when the function `funcs[5]()` is created, it captures the specific value of `i` for that iteration, which is `5`.
- When you call `funcs[5]()`, it returns `5`, the value of `i` at the time that function was created.

### Key difference:
- **`var`** creates a single, shared `i` across all iterations, and the functions all reference that same `i`.
- **`let`** creates a new, unique `i` for each iteration, so the functions capture the value of `i` at the time they are created.

### Summary:
- With `var`, all the functions return the final value of `i` (which is `10`).
- With `let`, each function captures the value of `i` for its particular iteration, so `funcs[5]()` will return `5` when called.
