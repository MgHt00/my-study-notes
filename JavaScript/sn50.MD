The last sentence means that the `||` (logical OR) operator will return the second operand if the first one is falsy. If **both** operands are falsy, it will return the second operand (which is also falsy).

Let's break it down:

- A **truthy** value in JavaScript is anything that isn't falsy, such as numbers other than `0`, non-empty strings, objects, etc.
- A **falsy** value includes `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and `""` (empty string).

### Here's how the `||` operator works:

- If the first operand is **truthy**, it will return the first operand and stop.
- If the first operand is **falsy**, it will check the second operand and return that one.

However, if **both** operands are falsy, it will return the second operand.

### Examples:

```javascript
console.log(0 || "hello");  // "hello" because 0 is falsy
console.log(false || null); // null because both are falsy
console.log("world" || "hello"); // "world" because the first is truthy
console.log(0 || "");  // "" because both are falsy
```

In the second example (`false || null`), since both operands are falsy, the result is `null`, which is the second falsy operand.

This helps in setting default values: for example, `let value = input || "default";` would assign `"default"` if `input` is falsy.
