<em>The author says: "the Symbol function never returns the same value twice, even when called with the same argument."  And in the other sentence, "Similarly, if you use symbolic property names and do not share those symbols, you can be confident that other modules of code in your program will not accidentally overwrite your properties."  

If Symbol() generate different symbols even using the same argument, why do we need to care about sharing sharing symbols when it comes to prevent overwriting the properties?</em>

That's a great question, and it's a subtle but important distinction! Let me clarify:

When the author says, *"the Symbol function never returns the same value twice, even when called with the same argument,"* they mean that every time you call `Symbol()`, it creates a **completely unique symbol**, even if you pass the same description (like `"mySymbol"`) to it. The description is just for debugging or reference purposes and doesn’t affect the uniqueness of the symbol.

So, calling `Symbol('mySymbol')` multiple times will return different symbols each time, like this:

```javascript
let sym1 = Symbol('mySymbol');
let sym2 = Symbol('mySymbol');
console.log(sym1 === sym2);  // false (they are different symbols)
```

**Why share symbols?**

Sometimes, you may **want** different parts of your program (or different modules) to refer to **the same symbol** so they can access the same property on an object. If you don't share the symbol, different parts of the code will be using different symbols, and they won’t be able to access the same property on the object.

For example:

1. If one module creates a symbol `Symbol('myKey')` and uses it as a property key:
   ```javascript
   let sym = Symbol('myKey');
   obj[sym] = 'value';
   ```

2. If another module also creates a symbol using the same argument `Symbol('myKey')`, it will create **a different symbol**. So when it tries to access `obj[sym]`, it won't find the property, because the symbols are unique.

That’s why the author says *"if you use symbolic property names and do not share those symbols, you can be confident that other modules of code in your program will not accidentally overwrite your properties."* Because the symbols are unique, even if another part of the program uses the same string description, they won’t be able to overwrite the symbol-based properties unless they **explicitly share the symbol**.

**How to share symbols?**

You can use `Symbol.for('mySymbol')` to create or retrieve the same symbol from a global symbol registry:

```javascript
let sym1 = Symbol.for('mySymbol');  // Creates or gets the symbol from the global registry
let sym2 = Symbol.for('mySymbol');  // Retrieves the same symbol
console.log(sym1 === sym2);  // true (they are the same symbol)
```

By using `Symbol.for()`, you ensure that different parts of your program can share and access the same symbol, and therefore access or modify the same property on an object.

**Summary:**

- `Symbol()` creates a unique symbol every time, even with the same description.
- If you don't share symbols, you prevent other code from accidentally accessing or overwriting your symbol-based properties.
- If you need to share a symbol across different modules, use `Symbol.for()` to ensure everyone is using the same symbol.
