The reason we often prefer `undefined` over a `TypeError` in JavaScript is because of how JavaScript's design allows programs to handle missing or undefined values more gracefully. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Graceful handling of missing values**:
   - **`undefined`** simply represents a missing value, meaning a property or variable that hasn’t been assigned a value. It’s a normal part of JavaScript and doesn’t crash your program. This allows the program to continue running, even if a certain property is not present.
   - A **`TypeError`**, on the other hand, is an actual runtime error that interrupts the program's execution. If not caught properly, it can cause the program to crash, breaking the user experience.

### 2. **Flexibility with undefined**:
   - In many cases, you can check if a value is `undefined` and handle it safely (e.g., provide a default value). This keeps the code flexible and robust. For instance:
     ```javascript
     let user = { name: "John" };
     let age = user.age ?? 25;  // if `age` is undefined, use default value 25
     ```
     Here, even if `user.age` is missing (undefined), the program doesn’t break, and we provide a sensible default value.

### 3. **Conditional property access**:
   - With conditional property access (e.g., `obj?.prop`), JavaScript allows you to avoid the potential `TypeError` caused by trying to access a property on `undefined` or `null`. Instead of throwing an error, it simply returns `undefined` if the property doesn’t exist.
     ```javascript
     let obj = null;
     console.log(obj?.prop);  // returns undefined instead of throwing TypeError
     ```
   - This approach makes your code more resilient. You can handle missing or undefined values later in the logic without crashing.

### 4. **Dealing with dynamic or optional data**:
   - In JavaScript, especially when working with dynamic data (e.g., user input, API responses, etc.), not every value will always be present. Accepting `undefined` allows the program to continue and lets you make decisions on how to handle it. Throwing a `TypeError` would halt execution, which is usually undesirable when working with real-world data where optional or missing properties are common.

### Conclusion:
   - **`undefined`** is more of a "normal" state indicating a missing or uninitialized value. It's something you can handle in the flow of your program.
   - **`TypeError`** represents an unexpected or invalid operation, which can crash your program if not handled properly.

By using `undefined` and avoiding `TypeError`, we can make our code more robust and prevent unnecessary crashes while handling missing data in a controlled way.
