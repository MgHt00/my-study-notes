### Key Concept:
- **Operator precedence** and **associativity** determine how **operators** are grouped in expressions. They decide the order in which operations are **performed**.
- However, **operator precedence and associativity** do **not** determine the order in which the **operands** (the values on which operators act) are evaluated.

### Operator Precedence and Associativity:
- **Operator precedence**: Determines which operator gets applied first when there are multiple operators in an expression. For example, in `a + b * c`, the `*` operator has higher precedence than `+`, so `b * c` is evaluated first.
- **Associativity**: Determines the order of applying operators when they have the **same precedence**. For example, for the `+` operator, which is left-associative, `a + b + c` is evaluated as `(a + b) + c`.

### Operand Evaluation Order:
While precedence and associativity decide the grouping of operators, **the order in which the operands themselves are evaluated** (i.e., the values or expressions being operated on) is determined by the **language rules**. In JavaScript, operands are always evaluated **left to right**, regardless of operator precedence or associativity.

### Example to Clarify:
```javascript
let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

let result = a + b * c;
```

1. **Operator Precedence**: The multiplication `b * c` is evaluated first, because `*` has a higher precedence than `+`.
   
   So, conceptually, the expression becomes:
   ```javascript
   result = a + (b * c);
   ```

2. **Left-to-right evaluation of operands**: Even though `b * c` has higher precedence, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` themselves are evaluated from **left to right**. So:
   - First, `a` is evaluated (1),
   - Then `b` is evaluated (2),
   - Then `c` is evaluated (3),
   - Finally, the multiplication (`b * c = 2 * 3`) happens, followed by the addition (`a + 6`).

### Another Example with Function Calls (Operands):
```javascript
function first() { console.log('First'); return 1; }
function second() { console.log('Second'); return 2; }
function third() { console.log('Third'); return 3; }

let result = first() + second() * third();
```

1. **Operator Precedence**: Multiplication (`second() * third()`) happens before the addition (`first() + ...`), because `*` has a higher precedence than `+`.

2. **Operand Evaluation (Left-to-Right)**:
   - Even though multiplication happens first, the **operands** (function calls) are evaluated **left to right**. So:
     - `first()` is evaluated first, and `"First"` is logged.
     - Then `second()` is evaluated, and `"Second"` is logged.
     - Finally, `third()` is evaluated, and `"Third"` is logged.

The final expression becomes:
```javascript
1 + (2 * 3) = 1 + 6 = 7;
```

Even though multiplication happens first, the **functions** are called left to right.

---

### Summary:
- **Operator precedence and associativity** decide which operators are grouped together, but they do **not** control when the operands are evaluated.
- **Operands** are always evaluated left to right in JavaScript, even if the operators they are part of have different precedence.
