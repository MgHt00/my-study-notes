The unary operators in JavaScript include operators like `++`, `--`, `!`, `typeof`, `delete`, and `void`. When we say they are **right-associative** and have **high precedence**, it means they are evaluated from right to left and are given priority over other operators.

Here are a few examples to illustrate this:

### Example 1: Unary Increment (`++`)
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = ++x;  // Pre-increment: x becomes 6, and y is assigned the value 6.
```
Here, the `++` has high precedence and is right-associative, meaning the increment happens first before assigning the value to `y`.

### Example 2: Using Multiple Unary Operators
```javascript
let a = 10;
let result = -!a;  // Negate the result of `!a`
```
- First, `!a` is evaluated. Since `a` is a truthy value (`10`), `!a` becomes `false`.
- Then, the `-` negates `false`, which turns into `-0`.

This shows the right-to-left evaluation. The `!` operates first, then `-` applies to the result of `!`.

### Example 3: Combining Unary Operators
```javascript
let b = 5;
let result = typeof --b;  // Pre-decrement b, then apply typeof
```
- First, `--b` happens, so `b` becomes `4`.
- Then `typeof 4` is evaluated, which returns `"number"`.

Since the unary operators are right-associative, `--b` is evaluated before `typeof`.

---

In all of these examples, the unary operators act before any other lower-precedence operators and they associate from **right to left**, meaning that the operator furthest to the right is evaluated first when there are multiple unary operators on a value.
