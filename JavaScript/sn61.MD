<em>In this case, is "x must not be negative" a message property?</em>

Yes, exactly! In the example:

```javascript
if (x < 0) throw new Error("x must not be negative");
```

the string `"x must not be negative"` becomes the `message` property of the `Error` object created by `new Error()`. When the `throw` statement is executed, this `Error` object is thrown, and if there's a `catch` block, it can access both the `name` and `message` properties of the `Error`.

Here’s a closer look at how it works:

```javascript
try {
    let x = -1;
    if (x < 0) throw new Error("x must not be negative");
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name);     // Logs: "Error"
    console.log(e.message);  // Logs: "x must not be negative"
}
```

In this example:
- `e.name` will be `"Error"`, which is the default `name` property for a generic `Error`.
- `e.message` will hold `"x must not be negative"`, as that’s the message we passed in. 

This approach is useful for creating custom error messages to make debugging easier!
