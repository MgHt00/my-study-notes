<em>In this case, is "x must not be negative" a message property?</em>

Yes, exactly! In the example:

```javascript
if (x < 0) throw new Error("x must not be negative");
```

the string `"x must not be negative"` becomes the `message` property of the `Error` object created by `new Error()`. When the `throw` statement is executed, this `Error` object is thrown, and if there's a `catch` block, it can access both the `name` and `message` properties of the `Error`.

Here’s a closer look at how it works:

```javascript
try {
    let x = -1;
    if (x < 0) throw new Error("x must not be negative");
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name);     // Logs: "Error"
    console.log(e.message);  // Logs: "x must not be negative"
}
```

In this example:
- `e.name` will be `"Error"`, which is the default `name` property for a generic `Error`.
- `e.message` will hold `"x must not be negative"`, as that’s the message we passed in. 

This approach is useful for creating custom error messages to make debugging easier!

<em>In this example you had given, can I provide a name property?</em>

Yes, you can provide a `name` property by creating a custom error object, allowing you to specify the name of the error type. JavaScript’s built-in `Error` constructor does not allow directly setting `name` in the constructor, but you can set it manually after creating the error object.

Here’s how it might look:

```javascript
try {
    let x = -1;
    if (x < 0) {
        let error = new Error("x must not be negative");
        error.name = "NegativeValueError"; // Custom name
        throw error;
    }
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name);     // Logs: "NegativeValueError"
    console.log(e.message);  // Logs: "x must not be negative"
}
```

Here, `"NegativeValueError"` is a custom error name, and you can provide any descriptive label you want to differentiate it from other errors. This can be very useful when you need to handle different types of errors separately.
