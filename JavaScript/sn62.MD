The authors are explaining a way to mimic the behavior of a `for` loop in a `while` loop. Normally, a `for` loop has an `initialize` step, a `test` condition, a `body`, and an `increment` step:

```javascript
for (initialize; test; increment) {
    body;
}
```

In a `for` loop, each part executes in a specific order:
1. `initialize` runs once, before the loop starts.
2. `test` checks if the loop should continue.
3. `body` is the main code executed each loop iteration.
4. `increment` updates the loop variable after each iteration.

In a `while` loop, we only have `test` and `body`, so we need to manually add `initialize` and `increment`. However, `while` loops handle `continue` statements differently than `for` loops. When we use `continue` in a `for` loop, it skips to the `increment` step and continues from there. In a `while` loop, `continue` skips directly to the next `test` check, without any opportunity to increment the loop variable.

The authors’ code solves this by placing the `increment` step in a `finally` block. Here’s how it works:

```javascript
initialize;
while (test) {
    try {
        body;     // main code block
        // Any `continue` here will skip directly to `finally` to run `increment`
    } finally {
        increment; // runs after each iteration, even if `continue` is encountered
    }
}
```

### Example Comparison of `for` vs. `while` with `continue`

Let's say we want a loop that increments from 0 to 4, printing only even numbers.

**Using a `for` loop:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i % 2 !== 0) continue; // skips odd numbers
    console.log(i); // only prints even numbers
}
```

**Using a `while` loop with `try/finally` to handle `continue`:**

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    try {
        if (i % 2 !== 0) continue; // skip odd numbers
        console.log(i); // only prints even numbers
    } finally {
        i++; // always runs after each iteration, even when `continue` is used
    }
}
```

In this `while` loop, `i++` will always run after each iteration due to `finally`, so it accurately mimics the `for` loop behavior, ensuring `increment` happens even when `continue` is encountered.
