In summary:
- **Read-only properties on the prototype** prevent the object from creating its own version.
- **Writable properties on the prototype** allow the object to "shadow" the prototype property with its own instance.

Here’s an example:

```javascript
const proto = {};
Object.defineProperty(proto, 'readOnlyProp', {
  value: 10,
  writable: false, // Makes the property read-only
});

const obj = Object.create(proto);

obj.readOnlyProp = 20; // This does nothing because `readOnlyProp` is read-only on the prototype

console.log(obj.readOnlyProp); // 10, because the assignment was ignored

// Now with a writable property
proto.writableProp = 30;
obj.writableProp = 40; // This creates `writableProp` on `obj` itself

console.log(obj.writableProp); // 40, as the new property shadows the prototype property
console.log(proto.writableProp); // 30, unaffected by the assignment to `obj`
```

This is why the prototype chain is examined during assignments: JavaScript first checks if assignment is allowed, then decides whether to create a new property on the object itself or to ignore the assignment.

Great observations! Let’s address each of your questions:

### 1. Are properties on a prototype writable by default?
Yes, properties added to an object’s prototype are generally **writable** by default. In the example I provided, `writableProp` is indeed writable by default. JavaScript makes properties writable, configurable, and enumerable unless specified otherwise. You can control these attributes when defining properties using `Object.defineProperty` to set `writable: false`, `configurable: false`, or other flags to fine-tune how properties behave.

### 2. Are JavaScript prototypes “live”?
Yes, **JavaScript prototypes are live**. Once an object is created, any changes made to its prototype are reflected in the object itself. For instance, if you add, remove, or modify a property on the prototype object, any object that inherits from this prototype will see those changes in real-time. This dynamic linkage to the prototype is powerful for flexibility but has a few implications:

   - **Prototype Lookup and Property Access**: Every time you access a property on an object, JavaScript checks the object’s properties first and, if it doesn’t find the property, moves up the prototype chain to search. This lookup is done every time the property is accessed, so any live changes to the prototype (like adding `writableProp` after `obj` is created) will be seen by `obj` immediately.

   - **Writability Check**: When you try to write to a property, JavaScript first checks the object itself. If the property doesn’t exist directly on the object, it checks if it can write by examining the prototype chain, which reflects any live changes.

Here’s an example demonstrating the “liveness” of prototypes:

```javascript
const proto = {};
const obj = Object.create(proto); // obj inherits from proto

// Add property to proto after obj is created
proto.dynamicProp = 'I was added later!';

console.log(obj.dynamicProp); // "I was added later!"

// Modify a prototype property after obj is created
proto.dynamicProp = 'I was modified!';

console.log(obj.dynamicProp); // "I was modified!"
```

In this example, changes to `proto` affect `obj` immediately since `obj` relies on `proto` for properties it doesn’t have directly. This dynamic relationship is a key feature in JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance system and enables both flexibility and potential for complex interactions within object hierarchies.

Yes, that’s exactly right! If a prototype property is read-only, trying to assign a value to an object’s property with the same name won’t create a new property on the object itself, nor will it update the read-only prototype property. The assignment will simply be ignored in non-strict mode, or it will throw an error in strict mode. So, JavaScript prevents overwriting or shadowing read-only properties in this way.
