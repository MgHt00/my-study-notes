Sure! In this code, the `return new C();` statement is used to ensure that `C` is always called as a constructor. Hereâ€™s how it works:

```javascript
function C() {
  if (!new.target) return new C(); // Ensure C is called as a constructor
  // ...rest of the function code
}
```

### Explanation of `return new C();`
- **`if (!new.target)`:** This line checks if the function `C` was called without the `new` keyword.
  - When `C` is called without `new` (like `C()`), `new.target` is `undefined`, so `!new.target` is `true`.
  - When `C` is called with `new` (like `new C()`), `new.target` is `C`, so `!new.target` is `false`, and this line is skipped.

- **`return new C();`:** If `C` was called without `new`, `return new C();` calls `C` again but with `new`. This returns a properly constructed instance of `C`.

### Example:
```javascript
let obj1 = new C(); // `new.target` is defined, so it creates a new instance of C
let obj2 = C();     // `new.target` is undefined, so it calls `return new C();` and returns an instance of C

console.log(obj1 instanceof C); // true
console.log(obj2 instanceof C); // true
```

In this way, even if `C()` is called incorrectly without `new`, it will still return a new instance of `C`, enforcing proper usage of the constructor.
