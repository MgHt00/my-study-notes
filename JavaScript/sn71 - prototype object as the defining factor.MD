This passage is highlighting the role of the **prototype object** as the defining factor in JavaScript's "class" or "type" system, rather than the **constructor function** itself.

Let’s go through it step by step:

### 1. The Role of the Prototype Object
In JavaScript, the "class" of an object is determined by its **prototype** rather than the constructor function that created it. So:
- If two objects inherit properties and methods from the same prototype object, JavaScript considers them to be of the "same class."

For example:
```javascript
function Animal() {}
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log("Animal speaks");
};

let animal1 = new Animal();
let animal2 = new Animal();

console.log(animal1.__proto__ === animal2.__proto__); // true
```
Here, `animal1` and `animal2` both inherit from `Animal.prototype`, making them instances of the same "class" in JavaScript's view.

### 2. The Constructor is Less Important Than the Prototype
The constructor function is usually used to initialize or set up the object’s properties, but it’s not strictly necessary for defining what "type" or "class" an object is.

JavaScript determines "type" based on the **prototype** rather than the specific constructor function used. So, if two constructor functions share the same prototype object, they effectively create instances of the same "class."

### 3. Example of Two Constructors Sharing a Prototype
Let’s define two constructor functions that both point to the same prototype object:

```javascript
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Point both constructors to the same prototype object
Dog.prototype = {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal sound");
  }
};

Cat.prototype = Dog.prototype;

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
let cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

console.log(dog.speak === cat.speak); // true
console.log(dog.__proto__ === cat.__proto__); // true
```

In this case:
- **`Dog` and `Cat` constructors** both reference the same prototype object, `Dog.prototype`, meaning both `dog` and `cat` are instances of the same "class" because they inherit from the same prototype.
- **Constructor functions are not what define the class**: even though `dog` was created with `Dog` and `cat` with `Cat`, they’re considered the same "type" because they inherit from the same prototype object.

### Summary
To wrap it up:
- **Prototype object** determines an object’s "class" identity in JavaScript.
- **Constructor function** is just a way to create and initialize objects, and two different constructor functions can effectively create instances of the same "class" if they share the same prototype object.

This makes JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance system quite flexible! It’s possible to create objects that share behaviors and properties even when they come from different constructors, as long as they share the same prototype.
