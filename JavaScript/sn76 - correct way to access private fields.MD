You're absolutely correct to question this! In the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
class Complex {
#r = 0;  // Private field
#i = 0;  // Private field

constructor(real, imaginary) {
  this.r = real;  // Should throw an error
  this.i = imaginary;  // Should throw an error
}

// other codes
}

let c = new Complex(2, 3);
let d = new Complex(c.i, c.r);  // Accessing private fields
```

The private fields `#r` and `#i` are declared using the `#` symbol. This means they can **only be accessed within the class**. If you try to access `c.r` or `c.i` outside the class (or even attempt `this.r` and `this.i` inside the class without the `#`), JavaScript will throw an error because those names (`r` and `i`) are not public properties.

### Correct Way to Access Private Fields
If the intent was to allow controlled access to the private fields, you would typically use getter and setter methods:

```javascript
class Complex {
  #r = 0;
  #i = 0;

  constructor(real, imaginary) {
    this.#r = real;
    this.#i = imaginary;
  }

  get real() {
    return this.#r;
  }

  get imaginary() {
    return this.#i;
  }
}

let c = new Complex(2, 3);
let d = new Complex(c.imaginary, c.real);  // Works via getters
```

### Why the Code is Misleading
If the original snippet is meant to work without errors, it likely omits some context or was written before JavaScript's private field syntax (`#`) was fully standardized. The issue is:

1. `this.r` and `this.i` attempt to access fields that don't exist. They should be `this.#r` and `this.#i`.
2. `c.i` and `c.r` attempt to access private fields directly, which is not allowed.

In short, the code as written would not work in modern JavaScript. It may need correction or clarification to ensure it aligns with how private fields function.
