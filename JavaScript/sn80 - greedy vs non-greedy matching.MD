The passage you provided discusses an important concept about how regex matching works, especially in relation to greedy and non-greedy quantifiers. Let's break it down:

### Key Concepts

1. **Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching**:
   - A **greedy quantifier** (`+`) matches as much as possible while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match.
   - A **non-greedy quantifier** (`+?`) matches as little as possible while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match.

2. **Regex Pattern Matching Process**:
   Regular expression engines work by **finding the first position** in the string where a match is possible. Once a potential match is found starting at a position, the engine tries to match the whole pattern from there, even if that means the match ends up being longer (for non-greedy quantifiers, the engine will try shorter matches first, but only at the same starting position).

---

### The Example in Detail

#### Pattern: `/a+?b/`
- `a+?`: Matches one or more `a`s, but does so non-greedily (as few as possible).
- `b`: Matches a `b` that must follow.

#### String: `aaab`
- The regex engine **scans left-to-right** to find the first position where a match is possible:
  - Starting at the **first `a`**, it sees that at least one `a` followed by `b` can match. This satisfies the pattern, so the engine matches `aaab` in its entirety (even though it is non-greedy).

#### Why It Doesn't Stop at a Shorter Match
The non-greedy quantifier (`+?`) ensures the match uses as few `a`s as possible **at the first position where the pattern can match**. However:
- Since the engine does not backtrack to try matches starting at the second or third `a`, it won't consider matches like `ab` starting at later positions.
- The engine has already "committed" to matching the `b` at the end of the string after consuming some `a`s.

---

### General Rule
In regex engines, **starting position trumps greediness**. The match will always begin at the earliest point in the string that allows a valid match, regardless of whether the quantifiers are greedy or non-greedy.

---

### Summary
For `/a+?b/` applied to `aaab`:
- The non-greedy quantifier ensures the match uses as few `a`s as possible, but only **starting from the first `a`**.
- Once a valid match starting at the first character is found (`aaab`), no other starting positions are checked.
