The authors' explanation revolves around **capturing groups** and **backreferences** in regular expressions. Letâ€™s break it down step by step using the example regex provided:

### The Example Regex

```regex
/[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?\sis\s(fun\w*)/mig
```

This pattern can be broken down as:
1. **`[Jj]ava`**: Matches "Java" or "java".
2. **`([Ss]cript)?`**: A capturing group that matches "Script" or "script" optionally (`?` means the group can appear 0 or 1 time).
3. **`\s`**: Matches a space character.
4. **`is`**: Matches the literal word "is".
5. **`\s`**: Matches another space.
6. **`(fun\w*)`**: A capturing group that matches "fun" followed by zero or more word characters (`\w*`).

### Understanding Capturing Groups

In this regex, there are **two capturing groups**:
1. **`([Ss]cript)?`** â€“ Group 1
2. **`(fun\w*)`** â€“ Group 2

When this regex is applied to a string, these groups capture the text that matches their respective patterns.

### What the Authors Mean About References

The authors state that references to capturing groups donâ€™t refer to the pattern itself, but to the **exact text matched** by the pattern during execution.

Letâ€™s illustrate this with an example:

```javascript
let text = "JavaScript is fun!";
let regex = /[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?\sis\s(fun\w*)/i;
let result = text.match(regex);

console.log(result);
```

### Output:
```
[
  "JavaScript is fun",
  "Script",  // Group 1 match
  "fun"      // Group 2 match
]
```

- **Group 1** captured `"Script"`.
- **Group 2** captured `"fun"`.

### Using References to Enforce Constraints

In some cases, you can use a **backreference** (e.g., `\1`, `\2`) to match the exact same text captured by a group earlier in the regex. This is useful for enforcing that different parts of a string contain the **same sequence of characters**.

#### Example:

```javascript
let regex = /(\w+)\s\1/;
let text = "hello hello";
console.log(text.match(regex));
```

### Explanation:
1. **`(\w+)`** â€“ Captures one or more word characters (e.g., `"hello"`).
2. **`\s`** â€“ Matches a space.
3. **`\1`** â€“ Refers to the text captured by the **first group** (`(\w+)`).

#### Output:
```
[ 'hello hello', 'hello' ]
```

This regex ensures that the same word appears twice consecutively.

### Summary of the Authorsâ€™ Statement

- **Capturing groups** store the **text** that matched their pattern.
- When you reference a capturing group (e.g., using `\1`), it enforces that the subsequent part of the string matches the **exact same characters** captured by that group.
- This is useful for checking if different parts of a string are identical.
