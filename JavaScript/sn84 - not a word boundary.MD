The `\B` in regular expressions is a special **non-word boundary** anchor, which matches any position where the boundary between a word character (`\w`) and a non-word character (`\W`) does not occur.

To break it down:

- `\B` matches a position **inside** a word, **not** at the boundary.
- It ensures that a match happens only between two word characters or between two non-word characters, but not where a word character meets a non-word character.

### Example:

If you want to match the sequence "abc" **only if it's not at the boundary of a word**, you can use this pattern:

```regex
\Bab\B
```

This will match "abc" in "abc123" or "xyzabcxyz" but **will not match** "abc" in " abc" (space before "abc") or "abc " (space after "abc"), because in those cases, a word boundary (`\b`) exists.

### Practical example:

Consider this string:
```plaintext
I love programming and coding!
```

- `\Bcoding\B` will match the word "coding" if it’s inside another word, such as "decoding" or "programcoding".
- But it **won't** match in "coding!" because there’s a word boundary (space or punctuation) at the end.

### Key takeaway:
- `\B` is used to match positions **inside** words, ensuring that the match does not occur at the start or end of a word.
