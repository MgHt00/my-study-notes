Certainly! The passage you quoted refers to how the `replace()` method in JavaScript can use **captured groups** (parenthesized subexpressions) in the replacement string.

Let's break this down with an example.

### Example of `replace()` with Captured Groups

```javascript
let str = "My phone number is 123-456-7890";
let newStr = str.replace(/(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})/, "($1) $2-$3");
console.log(newStr);
```

#### Explanation of the Regular Expression:

1. **Regular Expression**: `/(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})/`  
   - `(\d{3})`: The first capture group matches **three digits** (e.g., `123`).  
   - `(\d{3})`: The second capture group matches the next **three digits** (e.g., `456`).  
   - `(\d{4})`: The third capture group matches the final **four digits** (e.g., `7890`).  
   - The `-` symbols match the literal hyphens in the phone number.

2. **Replacement String**: `"($1) $2-$3"`  
   - `$1`: Refers to the **first capture group** (e.g., `123`).  
   - `$2`: Refers to the **second capture group** (e.g., `456`).  
   - `$3`: Refers to the **third capture group** (e.g., `7890`).  

#### Output:

```
My phone number is (123) 456-7890
```

### How It Works:

1. **Captured Groups**: The regular expression captures parts of the string based on the **parentheses** `()` around different parts of the pattern.  
2. **Replacement References**: In the replacement string, the `$` followed by a number (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, `$3`) refers to the text captured by those groups.  
3. **Reformatting**: The `replace()` method substitutes these references with the actual matched text.

### Summary of Key Points

- **Parenthesized Subexpressions**: `(pattern)` captures portions of the string.  
- **Numbering**: Captured groups are numbered from **left to right**, starting at `$1`.  
- **Replacement String**: `$1`, `$2`, etc., insert the captured text in the replacement string.

This makes `replace()` very powerful for reformatting and transforming strings! ðŸ˜Š
