When you `require` a module, it returns the value of **`module.exports`**. It doesn't return `exports`. The `exports` object is simply a local variable that points to the same object as `module.exports`.

You're correct that you can **completely replace** the `module.exports` object.

Here's the key part:
* **`module.exports`** is what is returned from a `require` call. You can reassign it. For example, `module.exports = myFunction`.
* **`exports`** is a convenience variable that is initially set to an empty object. You can only add properties to it, like `exports.name = 'John'`, but if you reassign it (e.g., `exports = { name: 'John' }`), it **breaks the link** to `module.exports`, and the change won't be reflected when the module is required.

So, when you `require` a module, you are always getting the final value of **`module.exports`**.

You're correct that initially, `exports` is an empty object. However, when you `require` a module, Node.js gives you the value of that module's **`module.exports`**, not `exports`. The `exports` variable is a local variable used *inside* the module to build the `module.exports` object.

Here's the correct flow:

1.  **Module Creation:** When Node.js starts loading a file (let's call it `myModule.js`), it creates a `module` object. It also creates a local variable called `exports` and sets it to reference `module.exports`. At this point, `exports` and `module.exports` are the same empty object.

2.  **Your Code Runs:** Your code in `myModule.js` runs. If you add properties using `exports.myVar = 10`, you are adding `myVar` to the object that both `exports` and `module.exports` point to.

3.  **Module is Exported:** When your code finishes, the `require` function in another file receives the final value of **`module.exports`**. 

The key takeaway is that `exports` is just a temporary variable used to populate `module.exports` and has no value outside the module. `module.exports` is the actual value that gets passed to the `require` statement.
