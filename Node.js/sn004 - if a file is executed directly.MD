That code snippet, `if (require.main === module) {}`, is a fundamental pattern in Node.js used to determine if a file is being **executed directly** or if it's being **imported as a module** into another file.

Here's a breakdown of what each part means and why this pattern is used:

-----

## 1\. What Each Part Means

| Part | Type | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`module`** | Object | The current module's object | Represents the current file being executed or imported. |
| **`require.main`** | Object | The main module's object | Represents the module that was **initially started** by Node.js (i.e., the entry point file). |
| **`===`** | Operator | Comparison | Checks if the current module object is exactly the same as the main module object. |

-----

## 2\. The Logic Explained

When you run a script using the command `node server.js`:

1.  Node.js sets the `require.main` property to the `module` object of the `server.js` file.
2.  Inside `server.js`, the expression `require.main === module` evaluates to **`true`**.

When you import that same script into another file, say `app.js`, using `require('./server.js')`:

1.  `require.main` still refers to the `module` object of the entry point file (`app.js`).
2.  Inside `server.js`, the expression `require.main === module` evaluates to **`false`** because the current `module` is `server.js`, but the `require.main` is `app.js`.

-----

## 3\. Why Use This Pattern?

This pattern allows you to write a single file that can serve two different functions:

| Purpose | Example Code |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Execution (CLI)** | If the file is run directly, execute code that is only needed for the main process, such as **starting a web server** or running a Command-Line Interface (CLI) task. |
| **Module Export (Library)** | If the file is imported, only run the code that defines the functions and data to be exported (via `module.exports`). This prevents the entire application from unexpectedly starting up when another file just wants to use a function from it. |

### Example

```javascript
// utils.js

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// 1. Export the function so others can use it
module.exports = { add };

// 2. This code runs ONLY if the file is executed directly
if (require.main === module) {
  console.log("--- Running utils.js as a main script ---");
  const result = add(5, 3);
  console.log(`The result is: ${result}`); // Output: The result is: 8
}
```
[G]
  * **If you run `node utils.js`**: Both the export and the `if` block code run.
  * **If you run `require('./utils.js')`**: Only the export runs; the `if` block is skipped.
