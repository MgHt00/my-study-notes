That line of code takes the raw file data read from the disk and converts it into an array of individual lines.

Here is a breakdown of what each method in the chain does, starting from the `data` variable:

### 1. `data.toString()`

* **Action:** The `fs.readFile()` function (from Node's built-in `fs` module) typically returns the file content as a **Buffer** object (raw binary data), not a readable string.
* **Purpose:** Calling `.toString()` on the `data` Buffer converts that raw binary data into a human-readable **string**, which is necessary for the next steps.

### 2. `.trim()`

* **Action:** The `.trim()` method is a standard JavaScript string method.
* **Purpose:** It removes **whitespace characters** from both the **beginning** and the **end** of the string. This is important because files often have a trailing newline character (`\n`) at the very end, and removing it prevents an empty string from being added to your array of lines.

### 3. `.split('\n')`

* **Action:** The `.split()` method is a standard JavaScript string method that divides a string into an ordered list of substrings and returns them as a new **array**.
* **Purpose:** By passing `'\n'` (the newline character) as the argument, the code tells JavaScript to break the large string into smaller strings wherever a newline occurs. The result is that each element in the new array, `lines`, is one complete line of text from the file.

### Summary

The entire line of code is a concise way to transform the binary data read from the file into an easily usable array for processing:

$$\text{Buffer} \rightarrow \text{String} \rightarrow \text{Trimmed String} \rightarrow \text{Array of Lines}$$
