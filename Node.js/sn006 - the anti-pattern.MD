That's an excellent question that highlights a common area of confusion when mixing synchronous and asynchronous patterns, especially in older Node.js style APIs.

The line is called synchronously because there's **no asynchronous operation** involved *before* the callback is executed.

Here's a breakdown of why:

### 1\. The Check is Instantaneous (Synchronous)

The line `if (typeof fileName !== 'string')` performs a basic type check. Checking a variable's type is a fundamental, non-blocking operation that the JavaScript engine completes **immediately**.

  * Since there's no waiting for I/O (like a file read or a network request) or a timer (like `setTimeout`), the code executes sequentially.
  * Once the `if` condition is met (`fileName` is not a string), the code proceeds immediately to the next line.

### 2\. The `cb` Call is Direct

The call to `cb(new TypeError('argument should be string'))` is a simple **function call** within the current execution stack.

  * The `cb` function executes right away, passing back an error object.
  * The `return` statement just exits the `fileSize` function immediately after the synchronous `cb` call. It does **not** make the callback itself synchronous or asynchronousâ€”it just ensures the rest of the `fileSize` function's code is skipped.

### The Problem with This Pattern (Sync/Async Mix)

While the code is technically correct for handling an immediate error, this pattern is often considered an **anti-pattern** in Node.js, referred to as **"Zalgo"**.

If a function sometimes calls its callback synchronously (on immediate errors) and sometimes asynchronously (on file I/O operations), the user of that function has to write complex code to guard against both scenarios, making their code unpredictable.

**Best Practice:** Even for immediate errors, a function designed to be asynchronous (like one accepting a callback) should typically defer the callback call using `process.nextTick()` or `setTimeout(..., 0)` to ensure a purely asynchronous interface.

```javascript
// Best Practice (Ensures asynchronous execution of the callback)
function fileSize (fileName, cb) {
  if (typeof fileName !== 'string') {
    // Defer the callback to the next tick of the event loop
    return process.nextTick(cb, new TypeError('argument should be string'));
  }

  // ... proceed with the actual asynchronous file I/O
}
```
