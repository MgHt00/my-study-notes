That's great advice from the author\! The **`pipeline` method** is a highly recommended utility in Node.js for consuming and combining multiple streams because it handles complexity—especially error handling and stream cleanup—better than older methods.

The `pipeline` method is available via the built-in `stream` module and is specifically designed to chain multiple streams together sequentially.

## 1\. What `pipeline` Does

The `pipeline` function connects an array of streams, making the output of one stream the input of the next. It ensures that data flows through all of them, from source to destination.

The key benefit is that `pipeline` automatically handles two major issues that you have to manage manually with older methods (like `stream.pipe()`):

1.  **Error Propagation:** If an error occurs in *any* stream in the pipeline, the entire pipeline is torn down, and the error is correctly passed to the final callback.
2.  **Resource Cleanup:** It ensures all streams are properly closed and resources are released, even if an error occurs. This prevents memory leaks and file descriptor exhaustion.

## 2\. Syntax and Structure

You access `pipeline` by importing it from the `stream` module:

```javascript
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
```

The function takes the following arguments:

```javascript
pipeline(stream1, stream2, stream3, ..., callback);
```

  * **`stream1`, `stream2`, etc.:** These are the individual stream instances (Readable, Writable, or Transform) to be chained.
  * **`callback`:** An optional function that runs only when the pipeline is completely finished (successfully) or if an error occurs. This is where you put your final cleanup or success logic.

## 3\. Example: Chaining File Operations

Here's an example of using `pipeline` to read a file, compress its content, and write the compressed data to a new file.

```javascript
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib'); // For compression

// 1. Create the streams
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt'); // Readable Stream
const gzipStream = zlib.createGzip();             // Transform Stream (Compresses data)
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt.gz'); // Writable Stream

// 2. Chain them with pipeline
pipeline(
  readStream,   // Source: read from 'input.txt'
  gzipStream,   // Transform: compress the data
  writeStream,  // Destination: write to 'output.txt.gz'
  (err) => {
    if (err) {
      // This automatically catches errors from ANY stream (read, gzip, or write)
      console.error('Pipeline failed:', err);
    } else {
      console.log('Pipeline succeeded! File compressed.');
    }
  }
);
```

In this example, if the `readStream` fails, the `gzipStream` and `writeStream` are immediately cleaned up and the error is passed to the final callback. This is the "even better way" the author referred to, as it's much safer and requires less boilerplate code than manually managing `pipe()` events.
