That's a logical assumption, but no, you're not quite right. You generally **cannot** use a standard JavaScript `try/catch` block directly around the asynchronous `pipeline` function to catch errors.

Here's why and the correct way to handle errors with `pipeline`:

-----

## Why `try/catch` Won't Work

The `pipeline` function is **asynchronous** and returns a Promise (if you don't provide a callback). A standard synchronous `try/catch` block can only catch errors that happen *immediately* within the synchronous flow of code.

Errors within the streams (like a network timeout or a file read error) occur *later*, in the asynchronous event loop. By the time these errors happen, the `try/catch` block has already finished executing.

-----

## The Two Correct Ways to Handle Errors

You have two reliable ways to handle errors with `pipeline`, depending on whether you use the callback style or the Promise style.

### 1\. Using the Callback (Recommended for Older APIs)

This is the method we just discussed. The final argument to `pipeline` is the error handler.

```javascript
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
// ... other streams defined

pipeline(stream1, stream2, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    // This catches ALL errors from ANY stream in the pipeline
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Pipeline finished successfully.');
});
```

This is a standard Node.js error-first callback.

### 2\. Using Promises with `async/await` (Modern and Cleaner)

If you omit the final callback, `pipeline` returns a **Promise**. You can then use `async/await` and a **`try/catch`** block to handle the error in the modern, synchronous-looking way.

```javascript
const { pipeline } = require('stream/promises'); // Note the /promises import

async function runPipeline() {
  try {
    // You MUST use the promisified version of pipeline
    await pipeline(stream1, stream2);
    
    // This runs only if the pipeline succeeds
    console.log('Pipeline finished successfully.');
  } catch (err) {
    // This try/catch now successfully handles the asynchronous error
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  }
}

runPipeline();
```

To use the Promise-based approach, you should specifically import `pipeline` from `stream/promises` (available since Node.js 15.0.0, or use a utility for older versions). This is generally the cleaner and preferred modern solution. [G]
