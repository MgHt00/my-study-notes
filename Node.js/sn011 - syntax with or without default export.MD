That's an interesting statement from the author, and it refers to how the **namespace import** (`import * as name from 'module'`) handles the default export within the ECMAScript Module (ESM) specification.

The author is correct that you can **always** use the `import * as name from 'module'` syntax, regardless of the type of exports a module has, because it handles the default export by placing it on a special `.default` property.

Here is how to use that syntax and how you access the exports:

-----

## How to Use the `import * as name` Syntax

When you use the namespace import syntax, you are creating a single object (the "namespace object") that contains all of the module's exports.

### 1\. The Syntax

```javascript
// In your application file (e.g., app.js)
import * as serviceName from './server.js';
```

In the example above, the `serviceName` variable is the **namespace object**.

### 2\. Accessing Named Exports

If your `./server.js` file has **named exports**:

```javascript
// In server.js
export const PORT = 3000;
export function startServer() { /* ... */ }
```

You access them as properties of the namespace object:

```javascript
// In app.js
console.log(serviceName.PORT);         // Accesses 3000
serviceName.startServer();           // Calls the function
```

### 3\. Accessing the Default Export

This is the key point. If your `./server.js` file has a **default export**:

```javascript
// In server.js
const server = require('http').createServer();
export default server;
```

The namespace object makes the default export available under a property named **`default`**.

```javascript
// In app.js
const serverInstance = serviceName.default; // Accesses the value of 'export default'
serverInstance.listen(serviceName.PORT);
```

### Summary of the Author's Point

The author suggests using the `import * as name` syntax because it is **robust and predictable**:

  * If the module has named exports, they are on `name.exportName`.
  * If the module has a default export, it is on `name.default`.
  * If the module has **both**, they are all available on the `name` object.

Therefore, you never have to worry about the module's exact structureâ€”you just know all its exported components are available under the `serviceName` namespace object.
