When you see a message indicating that your branch and `origin/main` have diverged, it means that:

1. **Your local `main` branch** has commits that are not on the remote `main` branch.
2. **The remote `main` branch** has commits that are not on your local `main` branch.

To resolve this, you typically have two options:

### Option 1: Merge the Remote Changes (Recommended)

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```
   This updates your local tracking branches without modifying your working directory.

2. **Merge the remote `main` branch into your local `main`**:
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   ```
   This will merge the changes from the remote `main` into your local `main`. If there are conflicts, Git will notify you, and you’ll need to resolve them.

3. **Push the merged changes back to the remote** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   This updates the remote repository with your merged changes.

### Option 2: Rebase Your Changes on Top of the Remote Branch

Alternatively, you can use `git rebase` to reapply your changes on top of the latest remote changes.

1. **Fetch the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Rebase your changes onto the remote `main`**:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
   This will move your local commits on top of the latest remote commits. If there are conflicts, you’ll need to resolve them.

3. **Push the rebased changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force-with-lease
   ```
   This updates the remote branch with your rebased changes. The `--force-with-lease` option ensures that you don’t accidentally overwrite changes that someone else might have pushed while you were rebasing.

### Which Option to Choose?

- **Merge**: If you want to keep the history of both branches and are comfortable with a merge commit, use `git merge origin/main`.
  
- **Rebase**: If you prefer a cleaner, linear history and don't mind rewriting your commit history, use `git rebase origin/main`.

### Summary

To resolve the divergence:

- Run `git pull` to fetch and merge the remote changes.
- Alternatively, fetch and rebase using `git fetch origin` followed by `git rebase origin/main`.
- Push the resolved changes back to the remote repository if necessary.
