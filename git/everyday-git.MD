Set the New Branch to Track the Remote Branch (Optional but recommended):
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
```

To delete the remote branch, you can use the following command:
```bash
git push origin --delete branch_name
```

Run the following command to see what branches have been merged into main (without switching to main):
```bash
git branch --merged main
```

This command explicitly specifies that you want to push to the main branch on the origin remote.
```bash
git push origin main
```

The Following uses the default settings (typically origin and the branch youâ€™re currently on). It pushes the changes to the upstream branch set in your repository.
```bash
git push
```

When you run this command, you are telling Git to merge changes from the remote-tracking branch origin/main (which is your local copy of the remote main branch) into your current branch. This way, you bring in the changes from the remote main branch into your current branch.
```bash
git merge origin/main
```
