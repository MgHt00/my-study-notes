When you delete a tag locally, it is not automatically deleted from the remote repository. To delete a tag from the remote, you need to use the `git push` command with a special syntax.

### Steps to Delete a Tag from the Remote:

1. **Delete the Tag Locally (if not already deleted)**:
   ```bash
   git tag -d <tag-name>
   ```
   Replace `<tag-name>` with the name of the tag you want to delete.

2. **Delete the Tag from the Remote**:
   To delete the tag from the remote repository, push the deletion:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete <tag-name>
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use:
   ```bash
   git push origin :refs/tags/<tag-name>
   ```

---

### Example:
Let's say the tag you want to delete is `v1.0.0`:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0             # Deletes the tag locally
git push origin --delete v1.0.0  # Deletes the tag from the remote
```

---

### Verify the Tag Deletion:
You can verify the deletion by fetching the tags and checking the list:
```bash
git fetch --tags
git tag
```
The tag should no longer appear in the list.
