# Deep Copy Using A Recursive Function:

    function deepCopy(obj) {
            if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') {
                return obj;
            }
        
            if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
                let copy = [];
                for (let i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
                    copy[i] = deepCopy(obj[i]);
                }
                return copy;
            }
        
            let copy = {};
            for (let key in obj) {
                if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                    copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key]);
                }
            }
            return copy;
        }

## Context of the Code
  
1. Check for null or non-object: The function first checks if obj is null or not an object. If so, it returns the value directly since primitives don't need deep copying.
2. Check if obj is an array: If the obj is an array, it creates an empty array copy.

#### The Loop and the Line in Question

    for (let i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
        copy[i] = deepCopy(obj[i]);
    }

#### Breaking Down the Line
- `for (let i = 0; i < obj.length; i++):` This is a for loop that iterates over each element in the array obj. The loop variable i starts at 0 and increments until it reaches the length of the array.

- copy[i] =: This part of the line is assigning a value to the ith index of the copy array. The copy array is being built element by element as the loop iterates.

- deepCopy(obj[i]): This part calls the deepCopy function recursively on the ith element of the obj array. The result of this deep copy operation (which will be a deep copy of the ith element) is assigned to the ith position of the copy array.

## What This Does
  
For each element in the original array obj:

It calls deepCopy on that element, which ensures that if the element itself is an array or an object, it will be deep copied as well.
It assigns the result of the deep copy to the corresponding index in the copy array.
Example
Let's look at an example to clarify:

javascript
Copy code
let original = [1, [2, 3], {a: 4}];
let deepCopiedArray = deepCopy(original);
When deepCopy is called with original:

It detects that original is an array.
It initializes an empty array copy.
It starts iterating over original.
For i = 0, deepCopy(1) simply returns 1 because 1 is a primitive value. copy[0] = 1.

For i = 1, deepCopy([2, 3]):

It detects [2, 3] is an array.
It initializes another empty array.
It iterates over [2, 3] and deep copies 2 and 3 (which are primitives).
It assigns [2, 3] to copy[1].
For i = 2, deepCopy({a: 4}):

It detects {a: 4} is an object.
It initializes an empty object.
It iterates over the object's properties and deep copies the value 4.
It assigns {a: 4} to copy[2].
The final result is a new array deepCopiedArray that contains deep copies of the elements from original, ensuring that nested arrays and objects are also deeply copied.
