Visual Studio Code has a shortcut to comment out a chunk of code as a JavaScript comment!

### Shortcut for Commenting a Block of Code in JavaScript:
1. **Select the code** you want to comment out.
2. Use the following shortcut:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + /`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + /`

This will toggle between commenting and uncommenting for both single-line and multi-line selections.

### Block Commenting Shortcut:
If you specifically want to use block-style comments (`/* ... */`) for multi-line code:
1. **Select the code** you want to comment.
2. Use the following shortcut:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Shift + Alt + A`
   - **Mac**: `Shift + Option + A`

This will wrap the selection in `/* ... */` block comments, making it ideal for commenting out multiple lines at once.
