Not at all! Using **が** instead of **は** is not *wrong*, but it changes the nuance slightly. Let me explain the difference between using **は** and **が** in this context:

---

### When to Use **が**:
- **猫がいない**:  
This focuses on *what specifically isn’t there*. The **が** marks **猫** as the subject, emphasizing the fact that "the cat" (as opposed to anything else) isn’t under the table.  

**Example Use Case**:  
Someone asks:  
- **何が机の下にいないんですか？**  
(What isn’t under the table?)  
You reply:  
- **猫がいない。**  
(The cat isn’t there.)

---

### When to Use **は**:
- **猫はいない**:  
This focuses more on the topic of the sentence. The **は** introduces **猫** as the thing you’re talking about and states that, in relation to the table, the cat isn’t there.  

**Example Use Case**:  
Someone asks:  
- **猫はどこですか？**  
(Where’s the cat?)  
You reply:  
- **猫は机の下にいない。**  
(The cat isn’t under the table.)

### Summary Table:

| Particle | Focus                          | Nuance Example                          |
|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **が**   | Subject of the sentence        | Emphasizes that the cat is specifically not there. |
| **は**   | Topic of the sentence          | Emphasizes the relationship of the cat to the location (the table). |

---

### Key Point:
Neither **は** nor **が** is wrong in this case, but they serve different purposes. Use **が** if you’re answering a question or emphasizing what isn’t there, and **は** if you’re introducing the topic of the sentence.
