In the sentence **どこに行くの？** (*Doko ni iku no?*), the **の (no)** at the end adds a sense of curiosity or a slight request for an explanation. It’s like saying, “Where are you going?” in a casual, friendly way, with an implied “...tell me!”

Here’s a bit more about the **の** ending:

1. **Expresses curiosity or expectation** – This **の** at the end of a question is often used to soften it and add a sense of wondering or expecting a response. It’s very natural in casual Japanese when talking to friends or family.

2. **Equivalent to “...is it?” or “...right?”** – It invites the listener to explain, as if saying, "Where *is* it you’re going?"

**Examples of の in casual questions:**

- **何を食べるの？** (*Nani o taberu no?*)  
  "What are you going to eat?"

- **どこで遊ぶの？** (*Doko de asobu no?*)  
  "Where are you going to hang out?"

Using **の** in these ways makes the questions sound friendlier and more conversational!
