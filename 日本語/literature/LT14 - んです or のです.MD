Great question! Let's break it down to understand why **いない** becomes **いないん** in your sentence:  

---

### Why "いないんですか" instead of just "いないですか"?
1. **んです** or **のです** is used to:
   - Add **explanation** or **emphasis** to the statement.
   - Show curiosity or seek clarification when asking a question.

2. The **ん** in **いないん** is a contraction of **の**, which links the verb **いない** with the particle **です** for this explanatory tone.  

---

### Sentence Breakdown:
- **何が** = "What" (as the subject).  
- **机の下に** = "under the table" (location marker).  
- **いないん** = **いない** (isn’t present) + **ん** (adds nuance for explanation/emphasis).  
- **ですか** = Polite way of asking a question.  

**Translation:**  
- "What isn’t under the table (and could you explain)?"

---

### Without "ん" (Less nuanced):
If you simply asked **何が机の下にいないですか**, it would still mean "What isn’t under the table?" but would sound a little blunt or flat, without implying you're asking for further clarification or explanation.  

---

### Nuance of **んですか**:
Using **んですか** makes the question feel more natural, conversational, and polite. It's commonly used when:
1. You’re genuinely curious.
2. You're inviting the listener to elaborate on the situation.

Great! Let’s practice with some examples and variations to deepen your understanding of **んですか**. 😊

---

### Example 1: Seeking clarification  
**どうしてここにいるんですか。**  
(*Dōshite koko ni iru n desu ka?*)  
- **Translation:** "Why are you here?"  
- **Explanation:** The **んですか** adds curiosity, making it feel like you’re asking for a reason or an explanation. Without **ん**, the question would be flatter: **どうしてここにいますか**.

---

### Example 2: Asking about a situation  
**何を食べているんですか。**  
(*Nani o tabete iru n desu ka?*)  
- **Translation:** "What are you eating?"  
- **Explanation:** With **ん**, it sounds more curious, like you noticed someone eating and want details. Without **ん**, it’s more of a factual question.

---

### Example 3: Indicating interest or concern  
**誰が来るんですか。**  
(*Dare ga kuru n desu ka?*)  
- **Translation:** "Who is coming?"  
- **Explanation:** The **ん** emphasizes interest in the answer. Without **ん**, it’s more formal and detached.
