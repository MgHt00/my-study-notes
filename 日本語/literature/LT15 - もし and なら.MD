Great question! Both **なら** and **もし** can express "if" in Japanese, but they have different nuances and uses. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### 1. **なら** (Nara)
- **Meaning**: "If it is the case that..." or "If we are talking about..."
- **Function**: Used for hypothetical or conditional statements, often based on a specific topic or condition that has been stated or implied.  
- **Nuance**: It feels more conversational and focuses on what will happen *if* a certain condition arises.

#### **Example Usage**:
- 日本に行く**なら**、富士山を見たい。  
  (*If you're going to Japan, I want to see Mt. Fuji.*)  
  → The sentence assumes you're already talking about going to Japan.  

- 図書館に行く**なら**、本を借りてきてください。  
  (*If you're going to the library, please borrow a book.*)  
  → It’s implied or assumed that the person might go to the library.

### 2. **もし** (Moshi)
- **Meaning**: "If..." (introducing a hypothetical or uncertain condition)
- **Function**: Used to emphasize the uncertainty of the condition or possibility.  
- **Nuance**: Adds a sense of "hypothetical-ness" or uncertainty, often paired with other conditional forms (like ～たら or ～ば).

#### **Example Usage**:
- **もし**雨が降ったら、ピクニックは中止です。  
  (*If it rains, the picnic will be canceled.*)  
  → Emphasizes the *possibility* of rain.  

- **もし**試験に合格したら、何をしますか？  
  (*If you pass the exam, what will you do?*)  
  → Emphasizes a *hypothetical* situation.

### Key Differences:
| **Point**              | **なら**                                         | **もし**                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Context Needed?**     | Yes, often assumes a context or topic is given. | No, introduces a completely new condition. |
| **Focus**               | Action or situation based on a condition/topic. | Uncertainty or hypothetical situations.     |
| **Tone**                | Casual, conversational.                        | More formal or explanatory.                |

### Combined Usage:
Sometimes, **もし** and **なら** can be used together for added clarity or emphasis:
- **もし**あなたが行きたい**なら**、一緒に行きましょう。  
  (*If you want to go, let’s go together.*)  

Here, **もし** introduces the hypothetical condition, and **なら** ties it back to the specific context.

---

### Conclusion:
- Use **なら** when the condition feels more certain or stems from a known topic.  
- Use **もし** when introducing a new, uncertain, or purely hypothetical condition.

Hope this clears it up! 😊
