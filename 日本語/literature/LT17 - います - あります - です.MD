Great question! Understanding when to use **います**, **あります**, and **です** is crucial because they serve different functions in Japanese. Let's break it down step by step with examples. 😊

---

### **1. います and あります**  
These are **existential verbs** and are used to describe **existence** or **location**.  

- **います**: For **living things** (e.g., people, animals).  
- **あります**: For **non-living things** (e.g., objects, plants, places).  

#### Examples:
1. **Existence**:  
   - 人がいます。(*There is a person.*)  
   - 本があります。(*There is a book.*)

2. **Location**:  
   - 犬は庭にいます。(*The dog is in the yard.*)  
   - 鍵はテーブルの上にあります。(*The key is on the table.*)

### **2. です**  
**です** is a **copula** (like "is" or "am" in English) and is used for describing **attributes** or **identity**, not existence or location.  

#### Examples:
1. **Attribute (Description)**:  
   - この本は面白いです。(*This book is interesting.*)  
   - 私は学生です。(*I am a student.*)

2. **Identity**:  
   - これは犬です。(*This is a dog.*)  
   - あそこは学校です。(*That over there is a school.*)
