Certainly! The verb **ある** (to exist for inanimate objects) has an irregular negative form in colloquial Japanese. Let's break it down and clarify with examples.

### Why is "あらない" ungrammatical?
In standard Japanese, we expect verbs to follow regular patterns when forming negatives. For **ある**, its expected negative form would have been "あらない." However, this form is not used, and instead, Japanese uses **ない** to express the negative of **ある**. This irregularity is unique to **ある** and a few related expressions.

### Contextual Examples:
#### 1. Talking about existence:
- **Positive:** テーブルの上に本があります。  
  _There is a book on the table._
  
- **Negative:** テーブルの上に本がありません。  
  _There is no book on the table._

#### 2. Using the casual form:
- **Positive:** そこに椅子があるよ。  
  _There is a chair there._

- **Negative:** そこに椅子がないよ。  
  _There is no chair there._

### Why **ないです** instead of **あらないです**?
- **ないです**: Common in polite but informal speech, especially in spoken language.
  - Example: お金がないです。  
    _I don’t have money._

- **あらないです**: Ungrammatical because the language has evolved to treat **ない** as the default negative for **ある**. Historically, **あらない** might have been possible, but modern Japanese no longer uses this form.

### Related Expressions
1. **ありません**: Polite, standard negative of **ある**.
   - 店にトイレがありません。  
     _There is no bathroom in the store._

2. **なくなる**: Means "to disappear" or "to run out of."
   - 砂糖がなくなった。  
     _The sugar is gone._
