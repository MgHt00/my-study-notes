はい、そのとおりです！😊 Yes, you can convert many nouns into verbs by combining them with **する**. These are called **verbal nouns** (or **する verbs**) in Japanese. This is a very common and flexible feature of the language.

---

### **How it works:**
1. **Start with a noun**: Many Japanese nouns inherently imply an action or process, such as 勉強 (study), 運動 (exercise), 練習 (practice), and 旅行 (travel).
2. **Add する**: By adding **する**, you turn the noun into an action (verb), which can then be conjugated like any other verb.

### **Examples:**
| **Noun**         | **Meaning**         | **する Verb**         | **Meaning**             |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| 勉強 (べんきょう) | Study              | 勉強する              | To study               |
| 運動 (うんどう)   | Exercise           | 運動する              | To exercise            |
| 練習 (れんしゅう) | Practice           | 練習する              | To practice            |
| 旅行 (りょこう)   | Travel             | 旅行する              | To travel              |
| 掃除 (そうじ)     | Cleaning           | 掃除する              | To clean               |
| 運転 (うんてん)   | Driving            | 運転する              | To drive               |

### **Conjugating the する Verb:**
The **する** part is treated as the verb, so you can conjugate it as follows:

| **Form**            | **Example**          | **Translation**              |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Present Polite      | 勉強します          | I will study.               |
| Negative Polite     | 勉強しません        | I won’t study.              |
| Past Polite         | 勉強しました        | I studied.                  |
| Volitional          | 勉強しましょう      | Let’s study.                |
| Te-form             | 勉強して            | Study and… / Please study.  |
| Causal (Plain)      | 勉強する            | (I) study.                  |

### **Can you use any noun?**
- Not every noun can combine with **する**. 
  - Only **verbal nouns** or abstract nouns that describe actions, processes, or activities can naturally pair with **する**.
  - For example, 勉強, 練習, and 運転 are actions, so adding **する** makes sense.
- Concrete nouns (like 猫 = cat or 車 = car) **cannot** pair with **する** unless they represent a specific action or borrowed phrase.

### **Fun Fact: Loanwords and する**
Many foreign (loan) words can also combine with **する**, especially for modern concepts.  
Examples:
- **メールする** = To email  
- **ゲームする** = To play a game  
- **ダンスする** = To dance
