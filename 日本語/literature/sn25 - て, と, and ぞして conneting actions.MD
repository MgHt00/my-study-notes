Great question! Each of these has a slightly different nuance and use case when connecting actions. Let's break down the differences:

---

### 1. **Connecting with て** (Te-Form)
   - **Usage:** Used to connect two actions in sequence, often implying that the second action follows the first closely in time.
   - **Example:** 朝ごはんを食べて、学校に行きます。  
     *Meaning:* "I eat breakfast and (then) go to school."
   - **Nuance:** The **て** form implies a natural flow or cause-and-effect relationship between actions. It’s more like “and then” or “after that,” showing that one action precedes the other.

---

### 2. **Connecting with と** (To)
   - **Usage:** Used to connect two nouns or to show that two actions happen simultaneously or as a set, not one after the other. Also commonly used for "if/when" conditional sentences.
   - **Example (simultaneous actions):** 笑うと、元気になります。  
     *Meaning:* "When I laugh, I feel better."
   - **Example (with nouns):** りんごとバナナを買いました。  
     *Meaning:* "I bought an apple and a banana."
   - **Nuance:** With verbs, **と** usually implies simultaneous or automatic outcomes. Unlike **て**, it doesn’t show a sequence where one action clearly happens after the other.

### 3. **Connecting with そして** (Soshite)
   - **Usage:** Used mainly in written or formal contexts to list events or actions, usually in chronological or logical order, without a strong sense of immediacy between them.
   - **Example:** 本を読みました。そして、レポートを書きました。  
     *Meaning:* "I read the book. And then, I wrote the report."
   - **Nuance:** **そして** is like “and” or “and then.” It can be used between sentences, often marking a pause before introducing the next action. It’s more formal and can emphasize a new or separate thought or action.

| Connector | Meaning       | Common Usage                           | Example                           |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **て**    | "and then"    | Connects actions in sequence          | 朝ごはんを食べて、学校に行きます。|
| **と**    | "and/if/when" | Connects nouns or simultaneous actions | りんごとバナナを買いました。|
| **そして**| "and then"    | Connects separate sentences formally   | 本を読みました。そして、レポートを書きました。|

---

**In summary:**  
- Use **て** when actions follow each other naturally.
- Use **と** for simultaneous actions or connecting nouns.
- Use **そして** for a more formal, sequential connection between separate sentences.

Here's a breakdown of the usage of してから as well:

- **してから**: This expression is used when one action needs to be completed *before* the next action begins. It emphasizes a sequential, "after doing" relationship.

Here's a comparison with examples:

| Expression | Usage | Example | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| **て form** | Simple connection; actions are related and happen in order. | ご飯を食べて、勉強します。 | I’ll eat, then study. |
| **と** | Lists related actions or describes simultaneous states, often formal. | 家に帰ると、お風呂に入ります。 | When I get home, I take a bath. |
| **そして** | Used between sentences; sequences two distinct actions or ideas. | 映画を見ます。そして、本を読みます。 | I’ll watch a movie. Then, I’ll read a book. |
| **してから** | Sequential; emphasizes that one action happens *after* another completes. | ご飯を食べてから、勉強します。 | After eating, I’ll study. |
