Great question! Let's break it down. In the sentence:

**また質問があれば教えてくださいね！**  
(*If you have more questions, please let me know!*)

### About **教え**
1. **教え** comes from the verb **教える** (*to teach; to inform; to tell*).  
   - **教える** is the dictionary form.
   - In this sentence, **教えて** is the **て-form** of **教える**.

2. **教えて** has two roles here:
   - It connects the verb **教える** to **ください**, turning it into a polite request:  
     **教えてください** (*please let me know / please teach me*).
   - It makes the sentence softer and more conversational, especially with the **ね** at the end, which adds friendliness.

### Sentence Breakdown:
- **また** = *again; more*  
- **質問** = *question(s)*  
- **が** = subject particle, marking "question(s)" as the topic.  
- **あれば** = *if there are* (conditional form of **ある**)  
- **教えてください** = *please tell me / let me know*  
- **ね** = *right?; please?* (used for emphasis or friendliness).

### Translation:
"If you have more questions, please let me know!"  

### Summary:
- **教え** is the root verb meaning "teach" or "inform."  
- In **教えてください**, it's a polite way of asking someone to share or inform you about something. 😊
