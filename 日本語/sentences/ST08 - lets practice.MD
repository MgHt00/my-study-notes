Great question! Let me break down how "Let's practice" becomes **練習しましょう** step by step. 😊

---

### **Step 1: Understand the noun "practice"**
- The Japanese word for "practice" is **練習（れんしゅう）**, which is a **noun**.
- To make it into an action (a verb), you combine it with the verb **する**, which means "to do."  
  So, **練習する** means "to practice."

---

### **Step 2: Make it polite**
- The polite form of **する** is **します**.  
  Therefore, **練習する** becomes **練習します**, meaning "I practice" or "I will practice."

---

### **Step 3: Turn it into "Let's practice"**
- To suggest doing something together ("Let's ..."), Japanese uses the **volitional form** of verbs.  
  - The volitional form of **します** is **しましょう**.  
  - So, **練習します** becomes **練習しましょう**, meaning **"Let's practice."**

---

### **Sentence Structure**
When you say **練習しましょう**, the **noun + する** structure stays intact:
- **練習** = practice  
- **する (しましょう)** = let's do

Combined: **練習しましょう** = Let's practice.

---

### Bonus: Casual version
If you wanted to say "Let's practice" in a more casual way, you would use the plain form:
- **練習しよう** = Let's practice (casual).

---

Does that clear it up? 😊

Great question! If **練習しましょう** means "Let's practice," and you want to say **"Let's practice some more"**, you can say:

### 1. **もう少し練習しましょう**
   - **もう少し (もうすこし)**: "a little more" or "some more."
   - This is the most natural way to say "Let's practice some more."

---

### Example Usage:
- **もう少し練習しましょう** – "Let's practice a bit more."
- **時間があるので、もう少し練習しましょう。** – "Since we have time, let's practice a bit more."

---

### 2. **もっと練習しましょう**
   - **もっと**: "more" or "further."
   - This can also work and carries the meaning of "Let's practice more" or "Let's practice further."

---

### Key Difference:
- **もう少し** feels a bit softer or implies a small additional effort ("just a little more").
- **もっと** is more general and emphasizes doing more without specifying how much more.

You can use either depending on the nuance you want. 😊 Would you like more examples?
