おはようございます！😊 Sure, I can help! To say **"What shall I do?"** in Japanese, you can use this phrase:

### **何をしましょうか？**  
**(なにをしましょうか？)**

---

### **Breaking it down:**
1. **何 (なに)**  
   - Means **"what."**

2. **を**  
   - Object marker particle, showing that **何** is the object of the verb.

3. **します (する)**  
   - The verb **する**, meaning **"to do."** In this case, it is in the polite volitional form (**しましょう**) to express **"shall I do."**

4. **か**  
   - Question particle to make it a polite question.

---

### **Usage Example:**
Imagine you're unsure about your next action:
- **何をしましょうか？**  
  - **What shall I do?**  

If you're asking a group or considering others' opinions:
- **次に何をしましょうか？**  
  - **What shall we do next?**
