You're almost there! Let's go over your sentence step by step.

Your sentence:

**先生、たから、コンピューターのノートのなまえを漢字の勉強は書けば、正しいですか。**

You are trying to say something along the lines of "If I write the name of the computer notebook for kanji study, is it correct?"

Let’s look at a few things to correct:

1. **たから**: This doesn't fit here in this sentence. The word **たから** means "treasure" or "precious" and doesn't apply to your intended meaning. Instead, if you want to start by addressing the teacher politely, **先生** (sensei) alone is enough. Or you could say **先生、もし** (Sensei, if...) if you want to start with "if."

2. **漢字の勉強は書けば**: You're asking if writing the name of a notebook for kanji study is correct. We need to make sure this part expresses the idea clearly:
   - **漢字の勉強** is "kanji study."
   - **書けば** is the correct conditional form of **書く** (kaku), meaning "if (I) write." But you need to clarify **what** you're writing (in this case, the name of the notebook).

3. **正しいですか**: This part is fine! You're asking if it's correct.

Here’s how to structure your sentence:

### Correct version:
**先生、もしコンピューターのノートの名前を漢字の勉強のために書けば、それは正しいですか。**

### Breakdown:
- **先生** (sensei) = teacher
- **もし** (moshi) = if (a more polite version, optional)
- **コンピューターのノートの名前** (konpyūtā no nōto no namae) = the name of the computer notebook
- **漢字の勉強のために** (kanji no benkyō no tame ni) = for kanji study (literally, "for the purpose of kanji study")
- **書けば** (kakeba) = if I write
- **それは正しいですか** (sore wa tadashii desu ka) = is it correct?

This sentence now means:
**"Teacher, if I write the name of the computer notebook for kanji study, is it correct?"**
