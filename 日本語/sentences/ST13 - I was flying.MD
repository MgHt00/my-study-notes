おはようございます！😊 Great question! Let's break it down.

### **"I was flying" in Japanese**
The correct way to express "I was flying" would be:  
**飛んでいました** (tonde imashita).  

---

### **Explanation**
1. **飛んでいる** (tonde iru) means "I am flying" (present continuous).
   - It describes an action happening **right now**.
   - For example:  
     **鳥が空を飛んでいる。** (*The bird is flying in the sky.*)

2. To say "I was flying" (past continuous), we need to change the verb **いる** into its past polite form:  
   **いました**.
   - So, **飛んでいる** → **飛んでいました**.
   - This indicates an ongoing action in the **past**.

### **Examples**
1. **飛んでいました** (*I was flying*):  
   - **昨日の夢で、空を飛んでいました。**  
     (*In yesterday's dream, I was flying in the sky.*)

2. **飛んでいる** (*I am flying*):  
   - **私は今、空を飛んでいる気分です。**  
     (*I feel like I am flying in the sky now.*)

3. **飛んでいない** (*I am not flying*):  
   - **鳥は今、飛んでいない。**  
     (*The bird is not flying now.*)

### **Colloquial Version**
In casual conversation, you might hear **飛んでた** instead of **飛んでいました**.  
- Example:  
  **昨日、飛んでた夢を見たよ。** (*I had a dream yesterday where I was flying.*)
