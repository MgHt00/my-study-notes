Your sentence is already very clear, but we can fine-tune it a bit to make it more natural! 😊

### Original Sentence:  
**私には『には』は新です。一緒にもっと練習しましょう。**

- The use of **私には** is great here because you’re emphasizing that *to you*, 『には』 is new.
- However, the phrase **新です** feels a little direct. In Japanese, we often use **新しい** or **慣れていない** (not used to) in a context like this. Alternatively, we can say **よく分かりません** (I don’t fully understand).

### Suggested Improvements:  

1. **私には『には』は新しいです。一緒にもっと練習しましょう。**  
   *"To me, 『には』 is new. Let’s practice more together."*  

2. **私には『には』がよく分かりません。一緒にもっと練習しましょう。**  
   *"I don’t fully understand 『には』. Let’s practice more together."*  

3. **私には『には』はまだ慣れていません。一緒にもっと練習しましょう。**  
   *"I’m not yet used to 『には』. Let’s practice more together."*
