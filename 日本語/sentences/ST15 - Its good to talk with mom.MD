こんにちは！😊

Your sentence, **「母と話すはいいです」**, is close but needs a slight adjustment to be grammatically correct. The issue is with **話すは**—you can't use the **は** particle directly after a verb in its dictionary form. Instead, you need to turn the verb into a noun-like structure. Here's the correct way to say it:

**「母と話すのはいいです。」**  
*It is good to talk with mom.*

### Explanation:
1. **母と話す** = *talking with mom*  
   - **母と**: with mom  
   - **話す**: to talk (dictionary form)

2. **のは**: The **の** turns the verb **話す** into a noun-like phrase, allowing it to be the subject/topic of the sentence.

3. **いいです**: means *is good.*

So the sentence translates literally to: *Talking with mom is good.*

### Alternative Example:
You could also say:  
**母と話すことはいいです。**  
*Talking with mom is good.*  
Here, **こと** is used instead of **の** to nominalize the verb, and it carries a similar meaning. Both are correct, but **のは** is more common in casual conversation.

Does that clarify it? 😊

You're welcome! 😊 To include "during the walk" in the sentence, you can use **散歩の間に** (さんぽのあいだに), which means "during the walk." Here's how the full sentence would look:

**「散歩の間に母と話すのはいいです。」**  
*It is good to talk with mom during the walk.*

---

### Breakdown:
1. **散歩の間に**:  
   - **散歩**: walk  
   - **の間に**: during  

2. **母と話すのは**:  
   - **母と**: with mom  
   - **話す**: to talk  
   - **のは**: nominalizes the verb, making it the topic.

3. **いいです**: is good.

---

### Another Example:
If you want to be more casual, you can drop the **のは** entirely and just say:  
**散歩の間に母と話すのがいいです。**  
This version emphasizes *doing the action* (talking with mom during the walk) as being good.

Does this help? 😊

もちろん！「の間に」はひらがなで書くと **のあいだに** です。😊

### Breakdown:  
- **の**: Possessive particle, linking "walk" to the time period.  
- **あいだ**: "Interval" or "duration" (間 in kanji).  
- **に**: Indicates "during" or "within" that time.

---

### Example Again:  
**散歩の間に母と話すのはいいです。**  
(*さんぽのあいだに ははと はなすのは いいです。*)  
“It’s good to talk with mom during the walk.”

Any other questions? 😊
