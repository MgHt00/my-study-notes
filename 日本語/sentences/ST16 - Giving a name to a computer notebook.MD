Of course! Here’s an explanation in English:

Your original sentence, **「コンピューターのノートの名前を『猫の餌』書けば、これは正しいですか。」**, is mostly correct, but it can be slightly adjusted to sound more natural. The revised version is:

**「コンピューターのノートの名前を『猫の餌』にすれば、これは正しいですか。」**  
("If I name the computer notebook 'Cat's Food,' is this correct?")

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **「書けば」 → 「すれば」**  
   - In Japanese, we don’t say "write a name" (名前を書く) when referring to naming something. Instead, we use 「名前を〇〇にする」 (to make the name something) or 「名前を〇〇と付ける」 (to give the name something).  

2. **Adding quotation marks: 「『猫の餌』」**  
   - Using quotation marks makes it clear that **猫の餌** (Cat's Food) is the name you are referring to.

### Meaning of the Final Sentence:  
"If I name the computer notebook 'Cat's Food,' is this correct?"

If the name "Cat's Food" is meant to be humorous, it works perfectly! 😊

Yes, **する** is the irregular verb in the sentence **「コンピューターのノートの名前を『猫の餌』にすれば、これは正しいですか。」**. 

### Why is it irregular?

2. **すれば**: The conditional form of **する**, meaning "if [you] do/make."

   - **する** → **すれば** (if you do/make)

### Meaning in Context:
In this sentence, **する** is used in the structure **[A を B にする]**, which means "to make A into B."  
- **コンピューターのノートの名前を『猫の餌』にする**: "To name the computer notebook 'Cat's Food.'"
- **すれば**: "If you do that."

### Full Meaning:
