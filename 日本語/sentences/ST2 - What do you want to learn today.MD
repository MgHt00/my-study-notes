Certainly! Let's break down the sentence **今日何を学びたいですか？** (きょう なにを まなびたい ですか？) into its parts:

### 1. **今日** (きょう)
- **Meaning**: "Today"
- This word is used to refer to the current day.

### 2. **何を** (なにを)
- **Meaning**: "What"
- **何** (なに) means "what," and the particle **を** marks the direct object of the verb. So, **何を** means "what [do you want to do/learn]."

### 3. **学びたい** (まなびたい)
- **Meaning**: "Want to learn"
- **学び** (まなび) comes from the verb **学ぶ** (まなぶ), meaning "to learn." 
- Adding **たい** to a verb stem indicates a desire to do that action, so **学びたい** means "want to learn."

### 4. **ですか** (ですか)
- **Meaning**: "Is it?" or "Do you?"
- **です** is the polite form of the verb "to be" (similar to "is" or "are"), and **か** is the question marker used at the end of the sentence to turn it into a question.

### Putting it all together:
- **今日何を学びたいですか？** (きょう なにを まなびたい ですか？)
