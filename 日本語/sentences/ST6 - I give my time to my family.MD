Your sentence is very close to being correct! Here's a breakdown and a slightly refined version to make it more natural:

### Original Sentence:  
**毎週火曜日家族に時間をあげます。**

### Corrections and Explanation:

1. **"あげます"**:  
   - **あげる** is used when you give something to **someone else**.  
   - In this case, you're talking about giving **your time** to **your family**, which is fine, but in Japanese, it's more natural to use a verb like **使います** ("use/spend") or **捧げます** ("devote/dedicate") for time rather than **あげます**.  
   - Using **あげます** here isn't wrong, but it might sound a little unusual for "giving time."

2. **Particle Placement**:  
   - While your use of **に** for "to my family" is correct, adding a **は** after **家族** can emphasize that it's your **family** you're dedicating time to.

3. **Politeness**:  
   - If you’re speaking casually, you could simplify the sentence slightly.
