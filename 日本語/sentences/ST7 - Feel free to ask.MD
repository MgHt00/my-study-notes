Of course! Your understanding is already on the right track! Let’s break down **いつでも聞いてくださいね** step by step:

### 1. **いつでも**  
- **いつ** means "when."
- **でも** adds the nuance of "any," making **いつでも** mean "anytime."

So, **いつでも** translates to "anytime" or "whenever."

---

### 2. **聞いて**  
- **聞く (きく)** means "to ask" or "to listen."
- The **て-form** of **聞く** is **聞いて**.
  - This is used to connect verbs or to request something in a polite way when combined with **ください** (more on that next).
  
Here, **聞いて** means "ask" (in a continuing sense).

---

### 3. **ください**  
- **ください** is a polite way to say "please" and is often paired with the **て-form** of a verb to make polite requests.

So, **聞いてください** means "please ask."

---

### 4. **ね**  
- **ね** is a sentence-ending particle. It is used to:
  1. Add emphasis.
  2. Confirm agreement or make the sentence sound more friendly and soft.

In this case, **ね** makes the sentence feel encouraging and supportive.

---

### Putting it all together:  
- **いつでも** = Anytime  
- **聞いて** = Ask (て-form of "to ask")  
- **ください** = Please  
- **ね** = For a friendly tone  

So, **いつでも聞いてくださいね** translates to:  
"Please feel free to ask anytime!" 😊
