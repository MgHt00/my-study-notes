Great question! Let me break down how "Let's practice" becomes **練習しましょう** step by step. 😊

---

### **Step 1: Understand the noun "practice"**
- The Japanese word for "practice" is **練習（れんしゅう）**, which is a **noun**.
- To make it into an action (a verb), you combine it with the verb **する**, which means "to do."  
  So, **練習する** means "to practice."

---

### **Step 2: Make it polite**
- The polite form of **する** is **します**.  
  Therefore, **練習する** becomes **練習します**, meaning "I practice" or "I will practice."

---

### **Step 3: Turn it into "Let's practice"**
- To suggest doing something together ("Let's ..."), Japanese uses the **volitional form** of verbs.  
  - The volitional form of **します** is **しましょう**.  
  - So, **練習します** becomes **練習しましょう**, meaning **"Let's practice."**

---

### **Sentence Structure**
When you say **練習しましょう**, the **noun + する** structure stays intact:
- **練習** = practice  
- **する (しましょう)** = let's do

Combined: **練習しましょう** = Let's practice.

---

### Bonus: Casual version
If you wanted to say "Let's practice" in a more casual way, you would use the plain form:
- **練習しよう** = Let's practice (casual).

Does that clear it up? 😊
