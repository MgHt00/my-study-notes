In Japanese, you wouldn't say **「毎土曜日」** for "every Saturday." Instead, you'd use **「毎週土曜日」** (*maishuu doyoubi*), which means "every Saturday" or literally "every week on Saturday."

Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **毎日** (*mainichi*): every day
- **毎週** (*maishuu*): every week
- **毎週土曜日** (*maishuu doyoubi*): every Saturday
- **毎月** (*maitsuki* or *maigetsu*): every month
- **毎年** (*mainen* or *maitoshi*): every year

Japanese often combines "毎" (meaning "every") with time units like "週" (week), "月" (month), or "年" (year) to specify recurring days or intervals. 😊
