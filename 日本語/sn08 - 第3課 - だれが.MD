だれは家で英語の映画を見ますか。

Your sentence is almost perfect! To make it grammatically correct, change **だれは** to **だれが**:

**だれが家で英語の映画を見ますか。**

Here's why:
- **だれが** is used because **が** marks the subject of the sentence when you're asking "who."
- **だれは** would sound unnatural here because **は** is usually used for known topics, not for questioning "who" is performing the action.

So, **だれが家で英語の映画を見ますか** translates to "Who watches English movies at home?" Perfect job otherwise! 😊

Arr, I remember that in the textbook, it says "question words like どれ and 何 cannot be followed by the particle は.". Can you give me an example of using 何が ?

Exactly! Question words like **どれ** (which one), **何** (what), and **だれ** (who) are usually followed by **が** when they are the subject of the sentence.

Here’s an example with **何が**:

**何が好きですか？**  
- This means "What do you like?"

Breaking it down:
- **何** (なに) means "what."
- **が** is the subject marker.
- **好き** (すき) means "like" or "is liked," and **ですか** turns it into a polite question.

So **何が好きですか** asks, "What is it that you like?" or simply, "What do you like?" 

You're definitely on the right track!
