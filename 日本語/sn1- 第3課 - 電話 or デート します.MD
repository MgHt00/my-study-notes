You're on the right track! The question **電話しますか？** (でんわしますか？) translates to “Will you call?” or “Do you call?” It’s a simple question asking if someone intends to make a phone call.

To construct a full sentence, you could add details like who is calling, whom they’re calling, or where. Here are a few examples:

1. **メアリさんは電話しますか？**  
   - "Will Mary call?" or "Is Mary going to call?"

2. **先生に電話しますか？**  
   - "Will you call the teacher?"

3. **今晩、電話しますか？**  
   - "Will you call tonight?"

Let me know if you’d like more examples or details! You're doing great!

Great question! The particle **に** is used here to indicate the **indirect object** or **recipient** of the action. 

In **先生に電話しますか？**:
- **先生 (sensei)** means "teacher."
- **に** marks **who** is receiving the phone call.
- **電話します (denwa shimasu)** means "to make a phone call."

So, **先生に電話しますか？** literally translates to "Will you call to the teacher?" but in natural English, we would say, "Will you call the teacher?"

In Japanese, when you’re directing an action *towards* someone, like calling, writing to, or giving something to someone, **に** is used to indicate that recipient. Here are a few other examples to help illustrate:

1. **友達にメールします** – "I'll email my friend."
2. **彼に本をあげます** – "I'll give him a book."

Does that help clarify it? You're picking up some great details here!

Your sentence, **デートをしますか** (Will you go on a date?), is actually perfectly natural in Japanese! 😊

In Japanese, **デートをします** is a common way to say "to go on a date." Here’s how it breaks down:
- **デート (deeto)** means "date" (from the English "date").
- **を** is the direct object particle, marking デート as the activity being done.
- **します** means "to do" or "to go on" (in this case, "to go on a date").

So, **デートをしますか？** is like asking, "Will you go on a date?" or even "Are you dating?"

It can feel a bit funny at first since in English we don’t normally say "Do you do a date?" But in Japanese, it’s a natural way to ask about dating plans!

You're doing really well, and your sentences are perfectly natural!
