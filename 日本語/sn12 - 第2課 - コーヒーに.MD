In the sentence **コーヒーにミルクを入れますか** (Would you like milk in your coffee?), the particle **に** is used to indicate the **target** or **destination** of an action—in this case, **where the milk is being added**.

Here's a breakdown of why **に** is needed:

- **コーヒー** – "coffee," the target of where the milk will go.
- **に** – particle indicating the target or recipient of an action.
- **ミルクを** – "milk," marked with **を** to show it's the direct object.
- **入れますか** – "to add" or "to put in" as a polite question.

### Why **に** Works Here
When you’re adding something **into** a container, object, or specific place, **に** often marks that destination. So here, **に** marks **コーヒー** (coffee) as the place where **ミルク** (milk) will be put.

Think of **に** as saying **"into"** or **"in"** in this case:
- コーヒーにミルクを入れますか → Would you like to add milk **into** the coffee?

This use of **に** is common in contexts where something is going *into* or *onto* something else, like:
- **箱におもちゃを入れます** – "Put the toy into the box."
