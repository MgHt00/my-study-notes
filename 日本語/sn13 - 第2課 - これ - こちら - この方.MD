You can say **こちらは誰ですか** when referring to someone in a photograph! This is a natural and polite way to ask "Who is this?" while pointing to a person in a picture.

Here's why it works:

- **こちら** (kochira) is a polite, slightly formal way of saying "this" or "this person" and often implies respect or courtesy. 
- **誰ですか** (dare desu ka) means "Who is it?"

When looking at a photo, **こちらは誰ですか** sounds perfectly natural and is common in conversational Japanese, especially if you’re showing respect or interest in the person’s identity. It’s equivalent to saying "Who is this person here?" in a polite way. 

So, both **これは誰ですか** and **こちらは誰ですか** are correct, with **こちら** just being a more formal or respectful option. 😊

If you’re referring to someone who is physically present, **これは** would be unnatural and potentially a bit rude. Instead, you’d typically use **こちら** or **この方** to refer to the person politely:

1. **こちらは誰ですか** – (Kochira wa dare desu ka?)  
   Meaning: "Who is this person?" (polite, respectful, commonly used when introducing or referring to someone present).

2. **この方は誰ですか** – (Kono kata wa dare desu ka?)  
   Meaning: "Who is this person?" (very polite and formal, with a sense of respect).

Using **これは誰ですか** would be interpreted as casual or impolite, as **これ** is often used for objects rather than people in person. So **こちら** or **この方** is the best choice for referring to someone who is physically present!
