Both **何さいですか** and **いくつ** are ways to ask "How old are you?" in Japanese, but they differ slightly in nuance and usage:

1. **何さいですか (なんさいですか)**  
   - This is a more direct and polite way to ask someone’s age.
   - **さい** (才 or 歳) specifically means "age" in Japanese, so **何さい** directly translates to "What age?"
   - This phrase is commonly used among adults or when asking someone who is older or who you don’t know well.  

   **Example:**  
   「あなたは何さいですか？」  
   ("How old are you?")

2. **いくつ**  
   - **いくつ** is a more casual, general word for "how many," but it’s also used to ask someone’s age, especially for children or among friends.
   - It’s often used with younger children or in casual conversations, making it a bit more informal and friendly.
   - Unlike **何さい**, it doesn’t contain the specific character for age, so it’s more indirect.

   **Example:**  
   「いくつですか？」  
   ("How old are you?")

### Summary:
- Use **何さいですか** in more formal or polite contexts.
- Use **いくつ** in casual settings, especially with children or close friends.
