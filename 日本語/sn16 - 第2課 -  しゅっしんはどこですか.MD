In Japanese, **しゅっしんはどこですか** (Where are you from?) is the most natural way to ask someone’s place of origin. Here’s why:

- **どこ** (where) is more commonly used because it naturally asks *where* someone is from, which aligns with the concept of **しゅっしん** (hometown or place of origin).
- **何** (what) is generally not used here because it sounds a bit strange in Japanese. Asking **しゅっしんは何ですか** (What is your hometown?) is less common and feels unnatural because it implies a different nuance—almost like asking "What is your identity?" rather than "Where are you from?"

So, stick with **しゅっしんはどこですか** for a polite, natural way to ask about someone’s hometown or origin. 😊
