Not quite! **ケーキを食べますか** translates to "Do you eat cake?" (or "Are you going to eat cake?"), which doesn’t fully capture the "Do you *want* to eat cake?" meaning. 

To express **"Do you want to eat cake?"**, you’d use the verb form **食べたい** (want to eat):

### Correct way:
**ケーキを食べたいですか？**

This uses **食べたい** (tabetai) to indicate a desire or want and is a common and polite way to ask if someone wants to eat something. 

### Full sentence breakdown:
- **ケーキ** – cake
- **を** – object marker (marking cake as the thing you want to eat)
- **食べたい** – want to eat
- **ですか** – polite question ending

So, **ケーキを食べたいですか？** is the natural way to say, "Do you want to eat cake?" 😊

Yes, exactly! **たい** is added to a verb stem to express **"want to"** do that action.

Here’s how it works with the verb **食べる** (to eat):

1. Take the stem of the verb **食べる** → **食べ**.
2. Add **たい** → **食べたい**, meaning **"want to eat."**

So, **たい** attaches to verb stems to show desire or want. Here are a few more examples:

- **行く** (to go) → **行きたい** (いきたい) → "I want to go."
- **見る** (to see/watch) → **見たい** (みたい) → "I want to see/watch."
- **する** (to do) → **したい** → "I want to do."

This **たい** form is very useful for expressing your wants and desires in Japanese! 😊

Of course! Here are some common verbs with **たい** to help you get the hang of expressing "want to" in Japanese:

1. **飲む** (のむ) - to drink  
   - **飲みたい** (のみたい) - "I want to drink."  
   - Example: **コーヒーを飲みたいです。**  
     *I want to drink coffee.*

2. **買う** (かう) - to buy  
   - **買いたい** (かいたい) - "I want to buy."  
   - Example: **新しい本を買いたいです。**  
     *I want to buy a new book.*

3. **読む** (よむ) - to read  
   - **読みたい** (よみたい) - "I want to read."  
   - Example: **雑誌を読みたいです。**  
     *I want to read a magazine.*

4. **会う** (あう) - to meet  
   - **会いたい** (あいたい) - "I want to meet."  
   - Example: **友達に会いたいです。**  
     *I want to meet my friend.*

5. **行く** (いく) - to go  
   - **行きたい** (いきたい) - "I want to go."  
   - Example: **日本に行きたいです。**  
     *I want to go to Japan.*

6. **作る** (つくる) - to make  
   - **作りたい** (つくりたい) - "I want to make."  
   - Example: **ケーキを作りたいです。**  
     *I want to make a cake.*

7. **遊ぶ** (あそぶ) - to play (or hang out)  
   - **遊びたい** (あそびたい) - "I want to play/hang out."  
   - Example: **友達と遊びたいです。**  
     *I want to hang out with my friends.*

The pattern is simple: for most verbs, just take the stem and add **たい**. Then you can use **たい** just like a regular **い** adjective, adding **です** at the end for politeness.

Yes, exactly! In **友達に会いたいです** (*I want to meet my friend*), **に** is used because **友達** (friend) is the "goal" or destination of the action **会う** (to meet). 

In Japanese, **に** often marks the person or place that is the target or destination of an action, like:

- **日本に行きたい** - I want to go to Japan (Japan as the destination).
- **先生に聞きたい** - I want to ask the teacher (teacher as the target of the question).

You're spot-on with this observation! 😊
