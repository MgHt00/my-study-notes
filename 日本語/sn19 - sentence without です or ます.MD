When **です** or **ます** isn’t added, it’s usually because the sentence is in a casual or plain form, often used in informal conversations. Here’s how it works:

- In Japanese, **です** is a copula that ends polite sentences (used after nouns and adjectives), and **ます** is used after verbs to make them polite.
- When we omit **です** or **ます**, the sentence is in plain form, which sounds less formal and is often used in casual settings, with close friends, family, or peers.

For example:

1. **日本に行きたい** (*Nihon ni ikitai*) → “I want to go to Japan.” (casual)
   - **日本に行きたいです** (*Nihon ni ikitai desu*) → “I want to go to Japan.” (polite)

2. **友達と話します** (*Tomodachi to hanashimasu*) → "I talk with my friend." (polite)
   - **友達と話す** (*Tomodachi to hanasu*) → "I talk with my friend." (casual)

Both versions are grammatically correct, but **です/ます** adds politeness, making it suitable for formal situations or with people you’re not very familiar with. In everyday conversation with friends, omitting **です/ます** is completely natural! 😊

Here are some simple examples using the dictionary forms of **行く (iku)**, **食べる (taberu)**, and **見る (miru)** in casual, everyday contexts:

---

### 1. 行く (iku) - "to go"
- **明日、海に行く**  
  (*Ashita, umi ni iku*)  
  "I'm going to the beach tomorrow."

- **どこに行くの？**  
  (*Doko ni iku no?*)  
  "Where are you going?"

---

### 2. 食べる (taberu) - "to eat"
- **今、昼ご飯を食べる**  
  (*Ima, hirugohan o taberu*)  
  "I’m eating lunch now."

- **何を食べる？**  
  (*Nani o taberu?*)  
  "What are you going to eat?"

---

### 3. 見る (miru) - "to see/watch"
- **友達と映画を見る**  
  (*Tomodachi to eiga o miru*)  
  "I’m watching a movie with my friend."

- **その写真を見たい**  
  (*Sono shashin o mitai*)  
  "I want to see that picture."

Each of these examples uses the dictionary form in a casual, conversational way. You’ll notice that it’s quite straightforward and natural in informal conversations! 😊

In the sentence **どこに行くの？** (*Doko ni iku no?*), the **の (no)** at the end adds a sense of curiosity or a slight request for an explanation. It’s like saying, “Where are you going?” in a casual, friendly way, with an implied “...tell me!”

Here’s a bit more about the **の** ending:

1. **Expresses curiosity or expectation** – This **の** at the end of a question is often used to soften it and add a sense of wondering or expecting a response. It’s very natural in casual Japanese when talking to friends or family.

2. **Equivalent to “...is it?” or “...right?”** – It invites the listener to explain, as if saying, "Where *is* it you’re going?"

**Examples of の in casual questions:**

- **何を食べるの？** (*Nani o taberu no?*)  
  "What are you going to eat?"

- **どこで遊ぶの？** (*Doko de asobu no?*)  
  "Where are you going to hang out?"

Using **の** in these ways makes the questions sound friendlier and more conversational!
