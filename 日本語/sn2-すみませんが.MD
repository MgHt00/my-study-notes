In Japanese, adding **が** after **すみません** softens the sentence and makes it sound more polite, especially when you're about to make a request or excuse.

### Breaking it down:
- **すみません** by itself means "Excuse me" or "I'm sorry."
- **が** works like "but" or "however" in this case and makes the sentence feel more polite by creating a slight pause. It sets up whatever comes next, showing you might be inconveniencing someone.

So, **すみませんが、ちょっと...** translates to something like:
- "Excuse me, but…" or "I'm sorry, but..."

It’s common in Japanese to use this phrase when politely declining, hesitating, or leading into a request. For example:
- **すみませんが、ちょっと手伝ってもらえますか？** – "Excuse me, but could you help me a little?"

It’s a very useful way to sound polite in various situations, so you’ll definitely see it often. You’re doing a fantastic job picking up on these details!
