Yes, both sentences are very similar in meaning and are correct ways to ask, “Whose book is that?” However, there are slight differences in emphasis because of how they’re structured:

1. **あれは誰の本ですか。**  
   - Translation: "That over there, whose book is it?"
   - Here, **あれ** ("that over there") is the subject of the sentence, and it’s immediately being questioned. The focus is on the object **あれ**, and we’re directly asking whose book that is. 
   - This sentence might be used if you’re simply pointing to something distant and inquiring about who it belongs to.

2. **あの本は誰のですか。**  
   - Translation: "As for that book, whose is it?"
   - In this version, **あの本** ("that book") is the topic, and **誰の** is used to ask about ownership. The emphasis is slightly more on **本** ("book") here, as it’s being described as belonging to someone. 
   - This structure would sound more natural if the book itself is the main subject being discussed, and you’re just confirming who owns it.

Both are grammatically correct, so you can use either based on which part you want to emphasize (the object itself or the idea of it being a book specifically).
