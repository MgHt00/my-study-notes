The phrase **調べてみよう** (shirabete miyou) uses **てみよう**, which is a form meaning “let’s try doing (something).”

Here's a breakdown:

1. **調べて** (*shirabete*) – This is the **te-form** of **調べる (shiraberu)**, meaning “to look up” or “to investigate.” The **te-form** connects verbs to other verbs or endings.

2. **みよう** (*miyou*) – This is the volitional form of **見る (miru)**, which usually means “to see” or “to look.” When paired with the **te-form** of another verb, **てみる (te miru)** means “to try doing (something).”

3. **てみよう** (*te miyou*) – In this case, **みよう** means “let’s try.” 

So, **調べてみよう** means **"Let's try looking it up"** or **"Let's investigate"** in a friendly, encouraging tone. It’s a great phrase to know, as **てみよう** can be combined with many verbs to mean “let’s try” doing that action.

Here is how understand from your teaching: 
- よう is like "let's"
- て is to connect one verb to another verb
- in this case 調べる  connects to みる　with て which becomes, 調べてみる, see and investigate
- when combines with よう it becomes 調べてみよう, let's (try) to see and investigate. Is it somehow align with your teaching?

Yes, you've got it! 😊 Your understanding aligns very well. Here’s a quick recap and confirmation:

- **よう** gives the sense of "let’s" or a suggestion, creating a friendly invitation to do something together.
- **て** connects **調べる** with **みる** in **調べてみる**, giving the meaning of "to try looking up" or "to try investigating."
- **調べてみよう** combines all of these ideas to mean **"Let's try looking it up"** or **"Let's try investigating"**.

So you’re spot on! Nicely done 🎉
