Great observation! In Japanese, the て-form of verbs sometimes changes to で depending on the verb's ending sound. This change affects how the て-form is pronounced but keeps its meaning and function.

Here's how it works:

1. **For verbs ending in** **む, ぶ, and ぬ**, the て-form changes to **んで**.
   - Example: 読む (to read) → 読んで (read and…)

2. **For verbs ending in** **く**, the て-form changes to **いて**.
   - Example: 書く (to write) → 書いて (write and…)

3. **For verbs ending in** **ぐ**, the て-form changes to **いで**.
   - Example: 泳ぐ (to swim) → 泳いで (swim and…)

4. **For verbs ending in** **る, う, and つ**, the て-form changes to **って**.
   - Example: 買う (to buy) → 買って (buy and…)

So in your sentence:
- **読む** (to read) ends in む, so its て-form becomes **読んで**.

This pattern allows you to use the て-form for connecting actions smoothly, like “reading *and then* writing.”

## The reason why 行く (to go) becomes 行って in the て-form

Great question! The reason why **行く** (to go) becomes **行って** in the **て-form** instead of **行いて** lies in a special rule of Japanese grammar. Let's break it down:

### Regular **て-form** Rules for Verbs Ending in く:
- For most verbs that end in **く**, the **く** changes to **いて** in the **て-form**.  
  Examples:
  - 書く (to write) → 書いて  
  - 聞く (to listen) → 聞いて  

### Exception for **行く**:
- **行く** is an exception to this rule.  
  Instead of following the normal pattern (**行いて**), it changes to **行って** in the **て-form**.  

### Why This Happens:
Historically, **行く** underwent a special phonetic change in the evolution of the Japanese language. This irregularity was preserved, making it an exception in modern grammar.

### Summary:
- Regular **く-ending verbs**: 書く → 書いて, 聞く → 聞いて  
- Irregular **行く**: 行く → 行って

This is a good example of why memorizing exceptions like **行く** is essential in Japanese! Keep up the great questions—you’re learning so well! 😊
