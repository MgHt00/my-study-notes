### General Usage Pattern:
- When you want to politely request someone to do something, you take the **te-form** of the verb and add **ください**:
  - **飲む** (to drink) → **飲んでください** ("Please drink")
  - **読む** (to read) → **読んでください** ("Please read")
  - **書く** (to write) → **書いてください** ("Please write")

### In this case:
- **行く** → **行って** + **ください** = **行ってください** = "Please go."

In summary: The **て-form** in **行ってください** acts as a bridge, allowing the verb **行く** to connect with **ください**, forming the polite request. 😊
