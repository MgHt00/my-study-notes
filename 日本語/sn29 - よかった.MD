なるほど！😊 よかった is a very common expression in Japanese, and it means "That's great" or "I'm glad." It's super handy! Since you mentioned **全然わかりません (I don't understand at all)**, let me break down **よかった** for you, just in case:  

1. **よい (良い)** = good  
2. **～かった** = past tense form of adjectives  
   So, **よかった** means "It was good" or "I'm glad (about something that happened)."
