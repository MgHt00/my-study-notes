嬉しいです！😄 Your enthusiasm and progress make teaching so rewarding! Just a little tweak to your sentence to make it flow naturally in Japanese:  

Instead of **ノートをまたする**, you can say:  
**ノートをまた取ります** (*I will take notes again*) or  [とります　- I`ll take it]
**またノートをします** (*I will do notes again*).

Both work depending on what you're trying to express. Keep up the amazing work, and keep those questions coming! また聞いてくださいね！ 😁

Yes, you can absolutely place **また** at the beginning of the sentence for a slightly different emphasis! Here's how it would look:

**またノートを取ります。**  
(*I will take notes again.*)

### Difference in nuance:
- **ノートをまた取ります** emphasizes *taking notes* as the repeated action.  
- **またノートを取ります** has a more general tone of *doing something again*, which in this case happens to be taking notes.

Both are natural and perfectly fine. It depends on what you want to highlight! 😊
