Ah, good question! Let’s break it down into a proper sentence:  

To say "I will take note to study," you can say:  
**勉強するためにノートを取ります。**  

### Breakdown:
1. **勉強する**: "to study" (plain/dictionary form of the verb).
2. **ために**: "for the purpose of" or "in order to." This connects the reason (studying) to the action (taking notes).
3. **ノート**: "notes."
4. **を**: Particle marking "notes" as the direct object.
5. **取ります**: "take" (polite form of the verb **取る**).

Great question! To say "I will remember to take note to study" in Japanese, you can say:

**勉強するためにノートを取るのを覚えます。**

### Breakdown:

1. **勉強するために**: "For the purpose of studying."
2. **ノートを取る**: "Take notes" (in plain form since it’s part of the structure with **の**).
3. **の**: Nominalizer, turning the action of taking notes into a "thing" (like "the act of taking notes").
4. **を**: Marks **ノートを取るの** as the object of the verb **覚える**.
5. **覚えます**: "Remember" (polite form of **覚える**, to remember or memorize).

### Literal Meaning:
"I will remember the act of taking notes for the purpose of studying."

If you want a simpler version, you could just say:  
**勉強のためにノートを取ることを覚えます。**  
(Using **こと** instead of **の**, which is another way to nominalize actions.)

Let me know if this helps or if you'd like further clarification! 😊
