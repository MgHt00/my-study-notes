Certainly! The verb **ある** (to exist for inanimate objects) has an irregular negative form in colloquial Japanese. Let's break it down and clarify with examples.

### Why is "あらない" ungrammatical?
In standard Japanese, we expect verbs to follow regular patterns when forming negatives. For **ある**, its expected negative form would have been "あらない." However, this form is not used, and instead, Japanese uses **ない** to express the negative of **ある**. This irregularity is unique to **ある** and a few related expressions.

### Why **ないです** instead of **あらないです**?
- **ないです**: Common in polite but informal speech, especially in spoken language.
  - Example: お金がないです。  
    _I don’t have money._

- **あらないです**: Ungrammatical because the language has evolved to treat **ない** as the default negative for **ある**. Historically, **あらない** might have been possible, but modern Japanese no longer uses this form.
