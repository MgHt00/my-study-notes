**「毎週土曜日はします。」** is grammatically correct! This means "I do (sports) every Saturday," and it’s clear and natural in Japanese.

To make it even more conversational, you could also say:
- **「毎週土曜日にしています。」** (*Maishuu doyoubi ni shiteimasu.*) — This implies that you *regularly* or *habitually* play sports on Saturdays.
- **「毎週土曜日にやっています。」** (*Maishuu doyoubi ni yatteimasu.*) — More casual and commonly used when talking about playing sports regularly.

Your answer is perfectly fine as it is, though! 😊

The form "やっています" comes from the verb "やる," which means "to do" or "to play" (as in sports). In Japanese, when we add "ています" (て form + います) to a verb, it can have a few meanings:

1. **Ongoing action** - This is like the English "-ing" form. For example:
   - スポーツをやっています。("I am doing sports." / "I am playing sports.")
   
2. **Habitual action** - It can also indicate an action done regularly or habitually. So if you say 毎週土曜日はスポーツをやっています, it means "I play sports every Saturday."

In your example:
- 毎週土曜日はやっています is a natural way to say "I do it every Saturday."
