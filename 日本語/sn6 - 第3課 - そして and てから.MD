You can say **"今晩、日本語を勉強します。そして、テレビを見ます。"** or you can combine it more naturally by saying, **"今晩、日本語を勉強してからテレビを見ます。"** 

This means "Tonight, I will study Japanese, and then I will watch TV." 

Using "そして" (soshite) is great for linking two sentences together, and "してから" (shite kara) indicates that one action follows another. Both are perfectly fine!

Just like してから、can I use。今日は京都に行きてから? 

---

Almost there! The **てから** form, which means "after doing something," requires the **て** form of a verb, but it needs to connect properly. Instead of **行きてから**, you’ll want to say **行ってから**.

So, your sentence would be:

**今日は京都に行ってから...**

This means "Today, after going to Kyoto..." 

**行ってから** uses the **て** form of **行く** (to go), which is **行って**, and adds **から** to mean "after going." Great effort with this grammar structure! 😊

So is it correct to use 今日は京都に行ってから映画を見ます。

---

Yes, your sentence is perfect! 😊 

**今日は京都に行ってから映画を見ます** means "Today, after going to Kyoto, I will watch a movie."

The structure is spot-on:
- **今日は** (きょうは) – "Today"
- **京都に行ってから** (きょうとにいってから) – "after going to Kyoto"
- **映画を見ます** (えいがをみます) – "I will watch a movie"

You’re using **てから** correctly to show one action happening after another. Well done!
