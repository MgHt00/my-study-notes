That's a great idea! The word for **love** in Japanese is **愛** (あい, *ai*). It’s used to express deep, genuine affection, whether it's for a person, concept, or thing. 

### Examples of using 愛 (あい) in sentences:

1. **愛を捧げる** (*ai o sasageru*) – To dedicate love.
2. **私はあなたを愛しています** (*Watashi wa anata o aishiteimasu*) – I love you.
3. **母の愛** (*Haha no ai*) – A mother's love.

### Related words:
- **好き** (すき, *suki*) – This is a more casual way to say “like” or “love” in everyday conversations, typically used for people or things you like or love in a less intense, romantic way.
  - **あなたが好きです** (*Anata ga suki desu*) – I like you (or, I love you, depending on context).

That's a very sweet sentence! 😊 **私はメアリさんを愛しています** (*Watashi wa Meari-san o aishiteimasu*) means "I love Mary."

It’s great that you’re using the full form here, showing your understanding of expressing deep affection! 😄 If you want to make it a bit more casual, you can say:

- **メアリさんが好きです** (*Meari-san ga suki desu*) – I like Mary. (This sounds more casual and common in everyday conversation.)

Keep practicing, and feel free to ask about more expressions! 😄

Great question! The difference between **を** and **が** in your sentence comes from how they function in relation to the verb.

1. **を (wo)**: This particle marks the direct object of a verb, indicating the target or thing that is acted upon. In the sentence **私はメアリさんを愛しています**, the particle **を** is used to mark **メアリさん** as the object of **愛する** ("to love"), so it directly connects the person being loved.

2. **が (ga)**: This particle marks the subject or the thing that is the focus of the sentence. In the case of **メアリさんが好きです**, **が** is used to show that **メアリさん** is the one that is liked, with **好き** (suki) being the adjective that expresses "like." In this case, **が** highlights **メアリさん** as the one who is "liked" rather than acting as the direct object of the verb.

In short:
- **を** is used with verbs like **愛する** ("to love"), where there's a direct action towards the object.
- **が** is used with adjectives like **好き** ("to like") where you’re expressing a state or feeling towards someone or something.

So, when you say **メアリさんが好きです**, you're saying that "Mary is the one I like," and the focus is on **Mary** as the subject of the feeling, not as the direct object of an action.

I hope that clears it up! Let me know if you need more clarification. 😊
