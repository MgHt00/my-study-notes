Certainly! "A Morning Run" can be translated as:

- **朝ラン** (*asa ran*) — This is a casual and commonly used expression in Japanese, especially among runners. It combines **朝** (morning) and **ラン** (run, borrowed from English).  
  Example: **朝ランをしました** (I went for a morning run).  

- **朝走り** (*asa hashiri*) — A more descriptive and slightly formal way to say "morning run," where **走り** comes from the verb **走る** (to run).  
  Example: **朝走りを楽しみました** (I enjoyed a morning run).  

Both are correct, but **朝ラン** is much more common in daily conversation!
