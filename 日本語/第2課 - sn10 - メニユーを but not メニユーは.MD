The reason **を** is used instead of **は** in **メニューをどうぞ** has to do with the function of **を** as the direct object marker.

Here’s the breakdown:

- **を** marks **メニュー** (menu) as the direct object of the verb **どうぞ**, which in this case is a polite way to say "here you go" or "please have this."
  
- **どうぞ** (please) doesn’t imply a topic but instead points to an action or suggestion, such as "please take this" or "please have this." Therefore, **を** is correct, as it connects **メニュー** with the action being offered.

If you used **は** (メニューはどうぞ), it would sound odd because **は** is a topic marker, and **どうぞ** isn't about giving information on a topic but rather offering something directly. The sentence **メニューをどうぞ** feels natural and polite because it's a direct, friendly way of saying "Here is the menu."
