Both **ミルク** (miruku) and **牛乳** (ぎゅうにゅう) mean "milk," but they’re used in slightly different contexts.

1. **ミルク** (miruku) – This term, borrowed from English, is often used for milk in a general sense, especially when referring to milk used in beverages (like coffee or tea), milk as an ingredient, or non-dairy milk substitutes. It’s common in cafes, on product labels, or in casual conversation.

   - Example: コーヒーにミルクを入れますか？ (Would you like milk in your coffee?)

2. **牛乳** (ぎゅうにゅう) – This term specifically refers to **cow's milk**. It’s more precise and is commonly used in supermarkets, on nutritional labels, or in contexts where it's important to specify that it’s dairy milk from cows.

   - Example: スーパーで牛乳を買いました。 (I bought milk at the supermarket.)

**Summary:**
- Use **ミルク** for milk in drinks, as an ingredient, or for milk substitutes.
- Use **牛乳** to specify cow’s milk, especially if you’re talking about dairy specifically.

If you’re ordering a drink with milk or talking casually, **ミルク** is very natural. If you’re at the grocery store or need to specify cow’s milk, then **牛乳** would be better! 😊
