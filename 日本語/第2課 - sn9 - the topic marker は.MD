In language, a **topic** is what the sentence is primarily about, or the main thing you want to talk about in the sentence. In Japanese, this is often marked by the particle **は** (pronounced "wa" when used as a particle).

Think of the **topic** as setting the scene for what follows in the sentence. It gives context to the listener, so they know what or who the rest of the sentence is referring to. Once a topic is established, you don't have to keep repeating it in conversation because everyone knows what or who you're talking about.

Here are a few examples to illustrate:

1. **わたしは学生です。**  
   Here, **わたし (I)** is the topic. **は** shows that we're talking about "I."  
   Translation: "As for me, I am a student."

2. **今日は天気がいいです。**  
   In this sentence, **今日 (today)** is the topic, so **は** tells us we're talking about today specifically.  
   Translation: "As for today, the weather is nice."

3. **メアリーさんはアメリカ人です。**  
   Here, **メアリーさん** is the topic, which **は** points out.  
   Translation: "As for Mary, she is American."

In Japanese, establishing a topic with **は** can add a lot of subtlety. For instance, if I say:

- **メニューをください。** ("Please give me the menu.")  
   There’s no topic here—**を** is simply marking "menu" as the object of the verb, making the sentence a direct request.

But if I said:

- **メニューはどうですか？** ("How about the menu?")  
   Here, **は** introduces "menu" as the topic, suggesting a shift in focus (maybe we're deciding what to look at or order first). 

By marking the topic with **は**, Japanese lets you highlight what you’re focusing on without needing to keep mentioning it.
