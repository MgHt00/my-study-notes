The form "やっています" comes from the verb "やる," which means "to do" or "to play" (as in sports). In Japanese, when we add "ています" (て form + います) to a verb, it can have a few meanings:

1. **Ongoing action** - This is like the English "-ing" form. For example:
   - スポーツをやっています。("I am doing sports." / "I am playing sports.")
   
2. **Habitual action** - It can also indicate an action done regularly or habitually. So if you say 毎週土曜日はスポーツをやっています, it means "I play sports every Saturday."

In your example:
- 毎週土曜日はやっています is a natural way to say "I do it every Saturday."

Let's say if I want to say a friend on phone that I am playing tennis, can I say: 今、テニスをやっています。?

Yes, **今、テニスをやっています** is a natural and correct way to say, "I'm playing tennis right now" on the phone! 😊

Here's the breakdown:
- **今** (いま) – now, at the moment
- **テニスをやっています** – "am playing tennis"

**やっています** works well here to describe an ongoing activity, making it sound very natural and conversational. You could also say **テニスをしています** (using する instead of やる), which is equally correct and just a slight stylistic difference.

Great job with this expression!
